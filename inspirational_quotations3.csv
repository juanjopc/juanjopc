16;In addition to my other numerous acquaintances, I have one more intimate confidant… My depression is the most faithful mistress I have known — no wonder, then, that I return the love.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
17;What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.... And people flock around the poet and say: 'Sing again soon' - that is, 'May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for the cry would only frighten us, but the music, that is blissful.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
18;A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;Love is the expression of the one who loves, not of the one who is loved. Those who think they can love only the people they prefer do not love at all. Love discovers truths about individuals that others cannot see;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;What if everything in the world were a misunderstanding, what if laughter were really tears?;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;Once you label me you negate me.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

29;If anyone on the verge of action should judge himself according to the outcome, he would never begin.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
30;Above all, do not lose your desire to walk. Everyday, I walk myself into a state of well-being & walk away from every illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it. But by sitting still, & the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill. Thus if one just keeps on walking, everything will be all right.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
31;The proud person always wants to do the right thing, the great thing. But because he wants to do it in his own strength, he is fighting not with man, but with God.;Soren A. Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;How did I get into the world? Why was I not asked about it and why was I not informed of the rules and regulations but just thrust into the ranks as if I had been bought by a peddling shanghaier of human beings? How did I get involved in this big enterprise called actuality? Why should I be involved? Isn't it a matter of choice? And if I am compelled to be involved, where is the manager—I have something to say about this. Is there no manager? To whom shall I make my complaint?;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;Truth always rests with the minority, and the minority is always stronger than the majority, because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory, formed by the gangs who have no opinion — and who, therefore, in the next instant (when it is evident that the minority is the stronger) assume its opinion… while truth again reverts to a new minority.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen but, if one will, are to be lived.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

39;I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
40;Don't you know that a midnight hour comes when everyone has to take off his mask? Do you think life always lets itself be trifled with? Do you think you can sneak off a little before midnight to escape this?;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
41;One must not think slightingly of the paradoxical…for the paradox is the source of the thinker’s passion, and the thinker without a paradox is like a lover without feeling: a paltry mediocrity.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
42;It is impossible to exist without passion;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
43;There is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
44;How absurd men are! They never use the liberties they have, they demand those they do not have. They have freedom of thought, they demand freedom of speech.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
45;It is the duty of the human understanding to understand that there are things which it cannot understand...;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46;If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
47;The self-assured believer is a greater sinner in the eyes of God than the troubled disbeliever.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
48;Listen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth — look at the dying man’s struggle at his last extremity, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
49;I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

51;The matter is quite simple. The bible is very easy to understand. But we Christians are a bunch of scheming swindlers. We pretend to be unable to understand it because we know very well that the minute we understand, we are obliged to act accordingly. Take any words in the New Testament and forget everything except pledging yourself to act accordingly. My God, you will say, if I do that my whole life will be ruined. How would I ever get on in the world? Herein lies the real place of Christian scholarship. Christian scholarship is the Church’s prodigious invention to defend itself against the Bible, to ensure that we can continue to be good Christians without the Bible coming too close. Oh, priceless scholarship, what would we do without you? Dreadful it is to fall into the hands of the living God. Yes it is even dreadful to be alone with the New Testament.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
52;The thing is to understand myself: the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. That is what I now recognize as the most important thing.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
53;Leap of faith – yes, but only after reflection;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
54;...why bother remembering a past that cannot be made into a present?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

56;On the secretly blushing cheek is reflected the glow of the heart;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
57;My sorrow is my castle.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
58;It is very important in life to know when your cue comes.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
59;Take away paradox from the thinker and you have a professor.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
60;I stick my finger into existence and it smells of nothing.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
61;I have only one friend, and that is echo. Why is it my friend? Because I love my sorrow, and echo does not take it away from me. I have only one confidant, and that is the silence of night. Why is it my confidant? Because it remains silent.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
62;A 'no' does not hide anything, but a 'yes' very easily becomes a deception.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
63;Once you are born in this world you’re old enough to die.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
64;Every mental act is composed of doubt and belief,but it is belief that is the positive, it is beliefthat sustains thought and holds the world together.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
65;And this is one of the most crucial definitions for the whole of Christianity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
66;The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation that the relation relates itself to its own self;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
67;Hope is a passion for the possible.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
68;Do you not know that there comes a midnight hour when every one has to throw off his mask? Do you believe that life will always let itself be mocked? Do you think you can slip away a little before midnight in order to avoid this? Or are you not terrified by it? I have seen men in real life who so long deceived others that at last their true nature could not reveal itself;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
69;Idleness, we are accustomed to say, is the root of all evil. To prevent this evil, work is recommended.... Idleness as such is by no means a root of evil;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
70;My melancholy is the most faithful sweetheart I have had.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
71;Never cease loving a person, and never give up hope for him, for even the prodigal son who had fallen most low, could still be saved;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
72;When I was young, I forgot how to laugh in the cave of Trophonius;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
73;Therefore do not deceive yourself! Of all deceivers fear most yourself!;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
74;If you want to be loathsome to God, just run with the herd.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
75;Now, with God's help, I shall become myself.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
76;What is talkativeness? It is the result of doing away with the vital distinction between talking and keeping silent. Only some one who knows how to remain essentially silent can really talk--and act essentially. Silence is the essence of inwardness, of the inner life. Mere gossip anticipates real talk, and to express what is still in thought weakens action by forestalling it. But some one who can really talk, because he knows how to remain silent, will not talk about a variety of things but about one thing only, and he will know when to talk and when to remain silent. Where mere scope is concerned, talkativeness wins the day, it jabbers on incessantly about everything and nothing...In a passionate age great events (for they correspond to each other) give people something to talk about. And when the event is over, and silence follows, there is still something to remember and to think about while one remains silent. But talkativeness is afraid of the silence which reveals its emptiness.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
77;The task must be made difficult, for only the difficult inspires the noble-hearted.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
78;My standpoint is armed neutrality.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
79;You love the accidental. A smile from a pretty girl in an interesting situation, a stolen glance, that is what you are hunting for, that is a motif for your aimless fantasy. You who always pride yourself on being an observateur must, in return, put up with becoming an object of observation. Ah, you are a strange fellow, one moment a child, the next an old man;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
80;What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
81;The only intelligent tactical response to life’s horror is to laugh defiantly at it;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
82;The difference between an admirer and a follower still remains, no matter where you are. The admirer never makes any true sacrifices. He always plays it safe. Though in words, phrases, songs, he is inexhaustible about how highly he prizes Christ, he renounces nothing, gives up nothing, will not reconstruct his life, will not be what he admires, and will not let his life express what it is he supposedly admires.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
83;The present state of the world and the whole of life is diseased. If I were a doctor and were asked for my advice, I should reply, 'Create silence'.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
84;What looks like politics, and imagines itself to be political, will one day unmask itself as a religious movement.;Soren Kieregaaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
85;Your own tactic is to train yourself in the art of becoming enigmatic to everybody. My young friend, suppose there was no one who troubld himself to guess your riddle--what joy, then, would you have in it?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;The same thing happened to me that, according to legend, happened to Parmeniscus, who in the Trophonean cave lost the ability to laugh but acquired it again on the island of Delos upon seeing a shapeless block that was said to be the image of the goddess Leto. When I was very young, I forgot in the Trophonean cave how to laugh;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;It belongs to the imperfection of everything human that man can only attain his desire by passing through its opposite.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;to have faith is precisely to lose one's mind so as to win God.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
89;I am convinced that God is love, this thought has for me a primitive lyrical validity. When it is present to me, I am unspeakably blissful, when it is absent, I long for it more vehemently than does the lover for his object.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;Adversity draws men together and produces beauty and harmony in life's relationships, just as the cold of winter produces ice-flowers on the window-panes, which vanish with the warmth.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;My melancholy is the most faithful mistress I have known;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
92;In my great melancholy, I loved life, for I love my melancholy.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;When I was very young and in the cave of Trophonius I forgot to laugh. Then, when I got older, when I opened my eyes and saw the real world, I began to laugh and I haven’t stopped since. I saw that the meaning of life was to get a livelihood, that the goal of life was to be a High Court judge, that the bright joy of love was to marry a well-off girl, that the blessing of friendship was to help each other out of a financial tight spot, that wisdom was what the majority said it was, that passion was to give a speech, that courage was to risk being fined 10 rix-dollars, that cordiality was to say ‘You’re welcome’ after a meal, and that the fear of God was to go to communion once a year. That’s what I saw. And I laughed.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;No! No one who was great in the world will be forgotten, but everyone was great in his own way, and everyone in proportion to the greatness of that which he loved. He who loved himself became great by virtue of himself, and he who loved other men became great by his devotedness, but he who loved God became the greatest of all. Everyone shall be remembered, but everyone became great in proportion to his expectancy. One became great by expecting the possible, another by expecting the eternal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;If anyone on the verge of action should judge himself according to the outcome, he would never begin. Even though the result may gladden the whole world, that cannot help the hero;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;What is existence for but to be laughed at if men in their twenties have already attained the utmost?;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;If you marry, you will regret it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;With every increase in the degree of consciousness, and in proportion to that increase, the intensity of despair increases: the more consciousness the more intense the despair;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;آیا مضحک تر از این مردم یافت می شود; که هیچ وقت از آزادی ای که دارند استفاده نمی کنند; اما آزادی ای که ندارند را می طلبند؟آن ها آزادی اندیشه دارند; و آزادی بیان می طلبند. آزادی بیان می طلبند تا جبرانی باشد برای آزادی اندیشه ای که تقریباً هیچ وقت به کارش نمی برند.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
101;"A strange thing happened to me in my dream. I was rapt into the Seventh Heaven. There sat all the gods assembled. As a special dispensation I was granted the favor to have one wish. ""Do you wish for youth,"" said Mercury, ""or for beauty, or power, or a long life";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;Out of love for mankind, and out of despair at my embarrassing situation, seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was unable to make anything easier than it had already been made, and moved by a genuine interest in those who make everything easy, I conceived it as my task to create difficulties everywhere.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
103;The daily press is the evil principle of the modern world, and time will only serve to disclose this fact with greater and greater clearness. The capacity of the newspaper for degeneration is sophistically without limit, since it can always sink lower and lower in its choice of readers. At last it will stir up all those dregs of humanity which no state or government can control.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;People understand me so little that they do not even understand when I complain of being misunderstood.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;What is youth? A dream. What is love? The dream's content.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;It is a frightful satire and an epigram on the modern age that the only use it knows for solitude is to make it a punishment, a jail sentence.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
107;.....love yourself.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;To be lost in spiritlessness is the most terrible thing of all.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;Of all ridiculous things the most ridiculous seems to me, to be busy — to be a man who is brisk about his food and his work. Therefore, whenever I see a fly settling, in the decisive moment, on the nose of such a person of affairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
110;Let other complain that the age is wicked;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;For he who loves God without faith reflects on himself, while the person who loves God in faith reflects on God.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;Whether you are man or woman, rich or poor, dependent or free, happy or unhappy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
113;When one has once fully entered the realm of love, the world — no matter how imperfect — becomes rich and beautiful, it consists solely of opportunities for love.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;دردها; اگر فرد را نشکنند; به او غرور می آموزند.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in everygeneration may not come that far, but none comes further.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;For love is exultant when it unites equals, but it is triumphant when it makes that which was unequal equal in love.;Soren Kierkeggard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;Since my earliest childhood a barb of sorrow has lodged in my heart. As long as it stays I am ironic — if it is pulled out I shall die.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
118;The stone that was rolled before Christ's tomb might appropriately be called the philosopher's stone because its removal gave not only the pharisees but, now for 1800 years, the philosophers so much to think about.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;Don't forget to love yourself.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;It happened that a fire broke out backstage in a theater. The clown came out to inform the public. They thought it was a jest and applauded. He repeated his warning. They shouted even louder. So I think the world will come to an end amid the general applause from all the wits who believe that it is a joke.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;Whoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;No, I won't leave the world--I'll enter a lunatic asylum and see if the profundity of insanity reveals to me the riddles of life. Idiot, why didn't I do that long ago, why has it taken me so long to understand what it means when the Indians honour the insane, step aside for them? Yes, a lunatic asylum--don't you think I may end up there?;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;"وحشتناک ترین جنگ ها زمانی رخ نمی دهد که دو طرف دیدگاه هایی مخالف داشته باشند؛ وحشتناک ترین جنگ ها زمانی رخ می دهد که دو طرف یک چیز می گویند"; ولی تفسیرشان از آن متفاوت است.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
124;And when the hourglass has run out, the hourglass of temporality, when the noise of secular life has grown silent and its restless or ineffectual activism has come to an end, when everything around you is still, as it is in eternity, then eternity asks you and every individual in these millions and millions about only one thing: whether you have lived in despair or not.;Soren Kierkegaar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;Only the person who is essentially capable of remaining silent is capable of speaking essentially.;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
127;When you were called, did you answer or did you not? Perhaps softly and in a whisper?;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
128;I stick my finger in existence — it smells of nothing. Where am I? Who am I? How came I here? What is this thing called the world? What does this world mean? Who is it that has lured me into the world? Why was I not consulted, why not made acquainted with its manners and customs instead of throwing me into the ranks, as if I had been bought by a kidnapper, a dealer in souls? How did I obtain an interest in this big enterprise they call reality? Why should I have an interest in it? Is it not a voluntary concern? And if I am to be compelled to take part in it, where is the director? I should like to make a remark to him. Is there no director? Whither shall I turn with my complaint?;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
129;What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
130;I once knew of a girl whose story forms the substance of the diary. Whether he has seduced others I do not know... we learn of his desire for something altogether arbitrary. With the help of his mental gifts he knew how to tempt a girl to draw her to him without caring to possess her in any stricter sense.  I can imagine him able to bring a girl to the point where he was sure she would sacrifice all then he would leave without a word let a lone a declaration a promise.   The unhappy girl would retain the consciousness of it with double bitterness because there was not the slightest thing she could appeal to. She could only be constantly tossed about in a terrible witches' dance at one moment reproaching herself forgiving him at another reproaching him and then since the relationship would only have been actual in a figurative sense she would constantly have to contend with the doubt that the whole thing might only have been an imagination.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;With respect to love we speak continually about perfection and the perfect person. With respect to love Christianity also speaks continually about perfection and the perfect person. Alas, but we men talk about finding the perfect person in order to love him. Christianity speaks about being the perfect person who limitlessly loves the person he sees.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;It's better to get lost in the passion than to lose the passion;Soren Kierkegäard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;My time I divide as follows: the one half I sleep;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
134;You train yourself in the art of being mysterious to everyone. My dear friend! What if there were no one, who cared about guessing your riddle, what pleasure would you then take in it?;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135;I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than a poet misunderstood by men.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
136;Life can only be understood going backward, but must be lived going forward.;SOREN KIERKEGAARD;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
137;Thus our own age is essentially one of understanding, and on the average, perhaps, more knowledgeable than any former generation, but it is without passion. Every one knows a great deal, we all know which way we ought to go and all the different ways we can go, but nobody is willing to move.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
138;The truth is a snare: you cannot have it, without being caught. You cannot have the truth in such a way that you catch it, but only in such a way that it catches you.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
139;...even the richest personality is nothing before he has chosen himself, and on the other hand even what one might call the poorest personality is everything when he has chosen himself;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
140;Life has its own hidden forces which you can only discover by living.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
141;شایع ترین نوع نومیدی آن است که فرد نخواهد خودش باشد.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
142;من زمانم را این گونه قسمت کرده ام: نیمش را می خوابم; و در نیمه دیگر رؤیا می بینم. حیف است که آدم در خواب رؤیا ببیند.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
143;Far from idleness being the root of all evil, it is rather the only true good.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
144;Deep within every human being there still lives the anxiety over the possibility of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the millions and millions in this enormous household. One keeps this anxiety at a distance by looking at the many round about who are related to him as kin and friends, but the anxiety is still there, nevertheless, and one hardly dares think of how he would feel if all this were taken away.;Soren Kieekegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145;People settle for a level of despair they can tolerate and call it happiness.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
146;Do you not know that there comes a midnight hour when every one has to throw off his mask? Do you believe that life will always let itself be mocked? Do you think you can slip away a little before midnight to avoid this?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
147;No one comes back from the dead, no one has entered the world without crying;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
148;I begin with the principle that all men are bores. Surely no one will prove himself so great a bore as to contradict me in this.;Søren Aabye Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
149;The more one suffers, the more, I believe, has one a sense for the comic. It is only by the deepest suffering that one acquires true authority in the use of the comic, an authority which by one word transforms as by magic the reasonable creature one calls man into a caricature.;Soren Kieregaaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
150;Nothing is as heady as the wine of possibility;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
151;For it is not what happens to me that makes me great, but it is what I do.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
152;A revolutionary age is an age of action;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
153;Men think that it is impossible for a human being to love his enemies, for enemies are hardly able to endure the sight of one another. Well, then, shut your eyes--and your enemy looks just like your neighbor.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
154;Purity of Heart Is to Will One Thing;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
155;Only the noble of heart are called to difficulty.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
156;I'm so misunderstood that people misunderstand me even when I tell them I'm misunderstood.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
157;People hardly ever make use of the freedom which they have, for example, freedom of thought;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
158;Sleeping is the height of genius;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
159;Silence is the demon's trap, and the more one is silenced, the more terrible the demon;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
160;No, not one shall be forgotten who was great in the world. But each was great in his own way, and each in proportion to the greatness of that which he loved.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
161;If I am capable of grasping God objectively, I do not believe, but precisely because I cannot do this I must believe. If I wish to preserve myself in faith I must constantly be intent upon holding fast the objective uncertainty so as to remain out upon the deep, over seventy thousand fathoms of water, still preserving my faith.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
162;What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I am to know, except in so far as a certain knowledge must precede every action. The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do: the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. ... I certainly do not deny that I still recognize an imperative of knowledge and that through it one can work upon men, but it must be taken up into my life, and that is what I now recognize as the most important thing.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
163;It is modest of the nightingale not to require anyone to listen to it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
164;Then faith's paradox is this: that the single individual is higher than the universal, that the single individual determines his relation to the universal through his relation to God, not his relation to God through his relation through the universal... Unless this is how it is, faith has no place in existence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
165;As I stood alone and forsaken, and the power of the sea and the battle of the elements reminded me of my own nothingness, and on the other hand, the sure flight of the birds recalled the words spoken by Christ: Not a sparrow shall fall on the ground without your Father: then, all at once, I felt how great and how small I was;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
166;To grumble about the world and its unhappiness is always easier than to beat one's breast and groan over oneself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
167;...my soul always reverts to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare. There at least one feels that it's human beings talking. There people hate, people love, people murder their enemy and curse his descendants through all generations, there people sin.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
168;Language has time as its element;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
169;A man who as a physical being is always turned toward the outside, thinking that his happiness lies outside him, finally turns inward and discovers that the source is within him.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
170;For I have trained myself and am training myself always to be able to dance lightly in the service of thought;Johannes Climacus S ren Kierkagaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
171;For like a poisonous breath over the fields, like a mass of locusts over Egypt, so the swarm of excuses is a general plaque, a ruinous infection among men, that eats off the sprouts of the Eternal.;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
172;It requires courage not to surrender oneself to the ingenious or compassionate counsels of despair that would induce a man to eliminate himself from the ranks of the living;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
173;He who loved himself became great in himself, and he who loved others became great through his devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
174;A human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
175;In a theater, it happened that a fire started offstage. The clown came out to tell the audience. They thought it was a joke and applauded. He told them again, and they became still more hilarious. This is the way, I suppose, that the world will be destroyed-amid the universal hilarity of wits and wags who think it is all a joke.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
176;And no Grand Inquisitor has in readiness such terrible tortures as has anxiety, and no spy knows how to attack more artfully the man he suspects, choosing the instant when he is weakest, nor knows how to lay traps where he will be caught and ensnared, as anxiety knows how, and no sharp-witted judge knows how to interrogate, to examine the accused as anxiety does, which never lets him escape, neither by diversion nor by noise, neither at work nor at play, neither by day nor at night.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
177;Above all, do not lose your desire to walk: every day I walk myself into a state of well being and walk away from every illness. I have walked myself into my best thoughts, and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
178;It is quite true what Philosophy says: that Life must be understood backwards. But that makes one forget the other saying: that it must be lived—forwards. The more one ponders this, the more it comes to mean that life in the temporal existence never becomes quite intelligible, precisely because at no moment can I find complete quiet to take the backward- looking position.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
179;People try to persuade us that the objections against Christianity spring from doubt. That is a complete misunderstanding. The objections against Christianity spring from insubordination, the dislike of obedience, rebellion against all authority. As a result, people have hitherto been beating the air in their struggle against objections, because they have fought intellectually with doubt instead of fighting morally with rebellion.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
180;Faith is the highest passion in a man.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
181;In the deepest sense, the being in a state of sin is the sin, the particular sins are not the continuation of sin, they are expressions of its continuation.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
182;شاعر کیست؟ انسانی اندوهگین که غم ژرفش را در قلب نهان می دارد; اما لب هایش چنان حالتی یافته اند که وقتی آه می کشد و ناله بر می آورد; از بین دو لب نغمه ای دلنشین به گوش می رسد. مردمی که در اطراف او جمع شده اند; می گویند: «باز هم بخوان;» که معنایش آن است که: «باشد که باز دردها روحت را شکنجه دهند; تا ما با نغمه ی ناله هایت به وجد آییم.»;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;
183;If someone who wanted to learn to dance were to say: For centuries, one generation after the other has learned the positions, and it is high time that I take advantage of this and promptly begin with the quadrille--people would presumably laugh a little at him, but in the world of spirit this is very plausible. What, then, is education? I believed it is the course the individual goes through in order to catch up with himself, and the person who will not go through this course is not much helped by being born in the most enlightened age.;Kierkegaard Soren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
184;To dare is to momentarily lose one’s footing. But not to dare is to lose one’s self.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
185;Loving just one is too little;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
186;You, who are so observant, will no doubt concede the generalization that people divide into two large classes, those who live mainly in hope and those who live mainly in recollection.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
187;My life is absolutely meaningless. When I consider the different periods into which it falls, it seems like the word Schnur in the dictionary, which means in the first place a string, in the second, a daughter-in-law. The only thing lacking is that the word Schnur should mean in the third place a camel, in the fourth, a dust-brush.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
188;To defend something is always to discredit it. Let a man have a warehouse full of gold, let him be willing to give away a ducat to every one of the poor - but let him also be stupid enough to begin this charitable undertaking of his with a defence in which he offers three good reasons in justification;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
189;I have never been joyful, and yet it has always seemed as if joy were my constant companion, as if the buoyant jinn of joy danced around me, invisible to others but not to me, whose eyes shone with delight. Then when I walk past people, happy-go-lucky as a god, and they envy me because of my good fortune, I laugh, for I despise people, and I take my revenge. I have never wished to do anyone an injustice, but I have always made it appear as if anyone who came close to me would be wronged and injured. Then when I hear others praised for their faithfulness, their integrity, I laugh, for I despise people, and I take my revenge. My heart has never been hardened toward anyone, but I have always made it appear, especially when I was touched most deeply, as if my heart were closed and alien to every feeling. Then when I hear others lauded for their good hearts, see them loved for their deep, rich feelings, then I laugh, for I despise people and take my revenge. When I see myself cursed, abhorred, hated for my coldness and heartlessness, then I laugh, then my rage is satisfied. The point is that if the good people could make me be actually in the wrong, make me actually do an injustice-well, then I would have lost.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
190;They call themselves believers and thereby signify that they are pilgrims, strangers and aliens in the world. Indeed, a staff in the hand does not identify a pilgrim as definitely as calling oneself a believer publicly testifies that one is on a journey, because faith simply means: What I am seeking is not here, and for that very reason I believe it. Faith expressly signifies the deep, strong, blessed restlessness that drives the believer so that he cannot settle down at rest in this world, and therefore the person who has settled down completely at rest has also ceased to be a believer, because a believer cannot sit still as one sits with a pilgrim's staff in one's hand – a believer travels forward;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
191;ماذا لو أن كل شيئ في هذا العالم هو عبارة عن سوء فهم؟ ماذا لو أن الضحك في الحقيقة هو عبارة عن بكاءء;سورين كيركجارد;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
192;I am so fed up and joyless that not only have I nothing to fill my soul, I cannot even conceive of anything that could possibly satisfy it - alas, not even the bliss of heaven.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
193;When I get up in the morning, I go right back to bed again. I feel best in the evening the moment I put out the light and pull the feather-bed over my head. I sit up once more, look around the room with indescribable satisfaction, and then good night, down under the feather-bed.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
194;Our age is essentially one of understanding and reflection, without passion, momentarily bursting into enthusiasm and shrewdly relapsing into repose.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
195;"... به همین خاطر است که جان من پیوسته به سوی عهد عتیق و شکسپیر باز می گردد: آن جا حداقل احساس می کنی که موجودی انسانی سخن می گوید؛ آن جا مردم نفرت می ورزند"; عشق می ورزند;" مردم دشمنانشان را به قتل می رسانند و فرزندانشان را نسل بعد از نسل نفرین می کنند؛ آن جا مردم گناه می کنند.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
196;About as genuine as tea made from a bit of paper which once lay in a drawer beside another piece of paper which had been used to wrap up a few tea leaves from which tea had already been made three times.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
197;I opened my eyes and saw the real world, and I began to laugh, and i haven't stopped since.;søren kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
198;عصر ما به موجب ذات خود; عصر تعمّق و فهم است; امّا از شور و شوق خالی است. همه کس همه چیز را می داند; همه کس می داند به چه راهی باید رفت و هر راه با راه دیگر چه تفاوت های جزئی ای دارد; امّا هیچ کس اراده ی حرکت ندارد.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
199;Faith is a marvel, and yet no human being is excluded from it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
200;"بی شک هیچ گاه عشق را تجربه نکرده؛ روحش بیش از آن آزاد است که عاشق بوده باشد.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
201;In the end, therefore, money will be the one thing people will desire, which is moreover only representative, an abstraction. Nowadays a young man hardly envies anyone his gifts, his art, the love of a beautiful girl, or his fame;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
202;What ability there is in an individual may be measured by the yardstick of how far there is between his understanding and his will. What a person can understand he must also be able to force himself to will. Between understanding and willing is where excuses and evasions have their being.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203;The most ludicrous of all ludicrous things, it seems to me, is to be busy in the world, to be a man who is brisk at his meals and brisk at his work. Therefore, when I see a fly settle on the nose of one of those men of business in a decisive moment, or if he is splashed by a carriage that passes him in even greater haste… I laugh from the bottom of my heart. And who could keep from laughing? What, after all, do these busy bustlers achieve? Are they not just like the woman who, in a flurry because the house was on fire, rescued the fire tongs?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
204;Aren't people absurd! They never use the freedoms they do have but demand those they don't have;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
205;There is nothing everyone is so afraid of as being told how vastly much he is capable of. You are capable of - do you want to know? - you are capable of living in poverty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
206;Do it or don’t do it — you will regret both.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
207;"A poet is an unhappy being whose heart is torn by secret suffrings, but whose lips are so strangely formed that when the sighs and the cries escape them, they sound like beautiful music. People corwd around the poet and say to him: ""Sing for us soon again";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
208;Let us speak of this in purely human terms. Oh! how pitiable a person who has never felt the loving urge to sacrifice everything for love, who has therefore been unable to do so!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
209;The paradox in Christian truth is invariably due to the fact that it is the truth that exists for God. The standard of measure and the end is superhuman;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
210;To pace about, looking to obtain status, looking to attain 'importance' - I can think of nothing more ridiculous.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
211;Seducing a girl is no art, but it needs a stroke of good fortune to find one worth seducing.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
212;You become what you understand.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
213;To have distinctiveness is to believe in the distinctiveness of everyone else, because distinctiveness is not mine but is God’s gift by which he gives being to me, and he indeed gives to all, gives being to all. (p. 271);Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
214;The majority of men in every generation, even those who, as it is described, devote themselves to thinking, live and die under the impression that life is simply a matter of understanding more and more, and that if it were granted to them to live longer, that life would continue to be one long continuous growth in understanding. How many of them ever experience the maturity of discovering that there comes a critical moment where everything is reversed, after which the point becomes to understand more and more that there is something which cannot be understood.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
215;So to be sick unto death is not to be able to die -- yet not as though there were hope of life;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
216;A poet is not an apostle;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
217;Just as a physician might say that there very likely is not one single living human being who is completely healthy, so anyone who really knows mankind might say that there is not one single living human being who does not despair a little, who does not secretly harbor an unrest, an inner strife, a disharmony, an anxiety about an unknown something or a something he does not even dare try to know, an anxiety about some possibility in existence or an anxiety about himself, so that, just as the physician speaks of going around with an illness in the body, he walks around with a sickness, carries around a sickness of the spirit that signals its presence at rare intervals in and through an anxiety he cannot explain.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
218;Faith is the most important factor in religious questions. If I am capable of grasping God objectively, I do not believe, but precisely because I cannot do this I must believe. If I wish to preserve myself in faith I must constantly be intent upon holding fast the objective uncertainty, so as to remain out upon the deep, over seventy thousand fathoms of water, still preserving my faith.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
219;Faith is namely this paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
220;هر گاه به من برچسب بزنی; من را نفی کرده ای.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
221;Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off.;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
222;And this is the simple truth--that to live is to feel oneself lost. He who accepts it has already begun to find himself, to be on firm ground. Instinctively, as do the shipwrecked, he will look around for something to which to cling, and that tragic, ruthless glance, absolutely sincere, because it is a question of his salvation, will cause him to bring order into the chaos of his life. These are the only genuine ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
223;I shall be your poet! I do not want to be a poet for others;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
224;I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding the motion is too powerful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
225;What distinguishes all love from lust is the fact that it bears an impress of eternity.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
226;Life has become a bitter drink to me, and yet it must be taken in drops, counted one by one.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
227;I can compel no man to agree with my opinions, but at least I can compel him to have an opinion.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
228;To be human, is not a fact, but a task.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
229;I have walked myself into my best thoughts and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it...but by sitting still, and the more one sits still, the closer one comes to feeling ill.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
230;People have an idea that the preacher is an actor on a stage and they are the critics, blaming or praising him. What they don't know is that they are the actors on the stage;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
231;the measure of a person’s disposition is this: how far is he from what he understands to what he does, how great is the distance between his understanding and his actions.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
232;Our life always expresses the result of our dominant thoughts.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
233;This is the way a person always gains courage;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
234;"هر كس به قدر عظمت آن چه با آن زورآزمايى كرد بزرگى يافت:آن كس كه با جهان ستيز كرد با چيرگى بر جهان بزرگ شد؛و آن كس كه با خويشتن نبرد كرد با چيرگى بر خويشتن بزرگ شد؛امّا آن كس كه با خدا زورآزمايى كرد از همه بزرگ تر بود.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
235;There is something frightful in the fact that the most dangerous thing of all, playing at Christianity, is never included in the list of heresies and schisms.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
236;The specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
237;la vida sólo puede ser entendida mirando hacia atrás;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
238;The Highest, after all, is not to  comprehend the Highest, but to do it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
239;If then, if you have lived in despair, then whatever else you won or lost, for you everything is lost, eternity does not acknowledge you, it never knew you, or, still more dreadful, it knows you as you are known, it manacles you to your self in despair.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
240;Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
241;Intelligence has got the upper hand to such an extent that it transforms the real task into an unreal trick and reality into a play.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
242;Be that self that one is;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
243;In our own day anonymity has acquired a far more pregnant significance than is perhaps realized: it has an almost epigrammatic significance. People not only write anonymously, they sign their anonymous works: they even talk anonymously...Nowadays one can talk with any one, and it must be admitted that people's opinions are exceedingly sensible, yet the conversation leaves one with the impression of having talked to an anonymity. The same person will say the most contradictory things and, with the utmost calm, make a remark, which coming from him is a bitter satire on his own life. The remark itself may be sensible enough, and of the kind that sounds well at a meeting, and may serve in a discussion preliminary to coming to a decision, in much the same way that paper is made out of rags. But all these opinions put together do not make one human, personal opinion such as you may hear from quite a simple man who talks about very little but really does talk. People's remarks are so objective, so all all-inclusive, that it is a matter of complete indifference who expresses them, and where human speech is concerned that is the same as acting 'on principle'. And so our talk becomes like the public, a pure abstraction. There is no longer any one who knows how to talk, and instead, objective thought produces an atmosphere, an abstract sound, which makes human speech superfluous, just as machinery makes man superfluous. In Germany they even have phrase-books for the use of lovers, and it will end with lovers sitting together talking anonymously. In fact there are hand-books for everything, and very soon education, all the world over, will consist in learning a greater or lesser number of comments by heart, and people will excel according to their capacity for singling out the various facts like a printer singling out the letters, but completely ignorant of the meaning of anything.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
244;The greatest danger to Christianity is, I contend, not heresies, heterodoxies, not atheists, not profane secularism – no, but the kind of orthodoxy which is cordial drivel, mediocrity served up sweet.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
245;In relationship to God one can not involve himself to a certain degree. God is precisely the contradiction to all that is 'to a certain degree'.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
246;Man has made a discovery ... the way to make life easy is to make it meaningless.;Kierkegaard, Soren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
247;Come, sleep and death;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
248;My soul is like the dead sea, over which no bird can fly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
249;There is a view of life which conceives that where the crowd is, there is also truth. There is another view of life which conceives that wherever there is a crowd, there is untruth.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
250;And to contend with the whole world is a comfort, but to contend with oneself dreadful.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
251;The more one suffers, the more, I believe, has one a sense for the comic.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
252;That God lets himself be born and becomes a human being, is no idle whim, something that occurs to him so as to have something to do, perhaps to put a stop to the boredom that has brashly been said to be bound up with being God-it is not to have an adventure. No, the fact that God does this is the seriousness of existence. And the seriousness in this seriousness is, in turn, that each shall have an opinion about it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
253;He who first invented the notion of defending Christianity is de facto Judas No. 2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
254;It is a question of discovering a truth which is truth for me, of finding the idea for which I am willing to live and die.;Kierkegaard, Søren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
255;Who tricked me into this whole thing and leaves me standing here? Who am I? How did I get into the world? Why was I not asked about it, why was I not informed of the rules and regulations and just thrust into the ranks as if I had been bought from a peddling shanghaier of human beings? How did I get involved in the big enterprise called actuality? Why should I be involved? Isn’t it a matter of choice? If I am compelled to be involved, where is the manager-I have something to say about this. Is there no manager? To whom shall I make my complaint?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
256;The crowd, in fact, is composed of individuals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
257;I am alone, as I have always been;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
258;I choose one thing: always to have the laughter on my side.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
259;Nothing ventured, nothing gained.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
260;And so when the generation, which itself desired to level and to be emancipated, to destroy authority and at the same time itself, has, through the scepticism of the principle association, started the hopeless forest fire of abstraction;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
261;In the Christianity of Christendom the Cross has become something like the child’s hobby-horse and trumpet.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
262;I have walked myself into my best thoughts and I know of no thought so burdensome that one cannot walk away from it.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
263;The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he meant to murder Isaac;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
264;Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect that boredom brings about is absolutely magical, but this effect is one not of attraction but of repulsion.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265;Deep within every man there lies the dread of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the tremendous household of millions and millions.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
266;He who does not know how to encircle a girl so that she loses sight of everything he does not want her to see, he who does not know how to poetize himself into a girl so that it is from her that everything proceeds as he wants it-he is and remains a bungler;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
267;But doubt is wily and cunning and never, as it is sometimes said to be, loud or defiant. It is unassuming and sly, not bold or assertive - and the more unassuming, the more dangerous.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
268;The spiritual differs from the religious in being able to endure isolation. The rank of a spiritual person is proportionate to his strength for enduring isolation, whereas we religious people are constantly in need of ‘the others,’ the herd. We religious folks die, or despair, if we are not reassured by being in the assembly, of the same opinion as the congregation, and so on. But the Christianity of the New Testament is precisely related to the isolation of the spiritual man.;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
269;Anxiety can be replaced only by the freedom whose harsh requirements are its cause. Being free requires us to release the brakes that anxiety represents in order to accept and appropriate our proper spiritual fulfillment or perhaps even to recognize, if that is what we in the end believe, that no such prospect is in store.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
270;The public is a host, more numerous than all the peoples together, but it is a body which can never be reviewed, it cannot even be represented, because it is an abstraction. Nevertheless, when the age is reflective and passionless and destroys everything concrete, the public becomes everything and is supposed to include everything. And that again shows how the individual is thrown back upon himself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
271;Only the one who descends into the underworld rescues the beloved.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
272;Reflection is not the evil;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
273;What is a poet? A poet is an unhappy being whose heart is torn by secret sufferings, but whose lips are so strangely formed that when the sighs and the cries escape them, they sound like beautiful music… and men crowd about the poet and say to him: Sing for us soon again;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
274;People unable to bear the martyrdom [...] unintelligently jump off the path, and choose instead, conveniently enough, the world’s admiration of their proficiency. The true knight of faith is a witness, never a teacher, and in this lies the deep humanity in him which is more worth than this foolish concern for others’ weal and woe which is honoured under the name of sympathy, but which is really nothing but vanity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
275;Whatever the one generation may learn from the other, that which is genuinely human no generation learns from the foregoing...Thus no generation has learned from another to love, no generation begins at any other point than at the beginning, no generation has a shorter task assigned to it than had the previous generation.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
276;Now she has power and passion and the struggle has significance for me-let the momentary consequences be what they may. Suppose that in her pride she becomes giddy, suppose that she does break with me-all right! -she has her freedom, but she will still belong to me. That the engagement should bind her is silly-I want to possess her only in her freedom;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
277;What a difference! Under the esthetic sky, everything is buoyant, beautiful, transient! when ethics arrives on the scene, everything becomes harsh, angular and infinitely boring;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
278;He cannot become old, for he has never been young;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
279;When you are one of several, then you have lost your freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
280;No one is any longer carried away by the desire for the good to perform great things, no one is precipitated by evil into atrocious sins, and so there is nothing for either the good or the bad to talk about, and yet for that very reason people gossip all the more, since ambiguity is tremendously stimulating and much more verbose than rejoicing over goodness or repentance over evil.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
281;In order than everything should be reduced to the same level, it is first of all necessary to procure a phantom, its spirit, a monstrous abstraction, an all-embracing something which is nothing, a mirage--and that phantom is the public.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
282;More and more individuals, owing to their bloodless indolence, will aspire to be nothing at all--in order to become the public: that abstract whole formed in the most ludicrous way, by all participants becoming a third party (an onlooker).;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
283;The more a person limits himself, the more resourceful he becomes.;kierkegaard De Soren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
284;No one may pride himself at being more than an individual, and no one despondently think that he is not an individual...;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
285;Now, it is of course well known that Christ continually uses the expression 'imitators.' He never says that he asks for admirers, adoring admirers, adherents;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
286;On the whole, the longing for solitude is a sign that there still is spirit in a person and is the measure of what spirit there is. [...] In antiquity as well as in the Middle Ages there was an awareness of this longing for solitude and a respect for what it means;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

289;For the sadness in legitimate humour consists in the fact that honestly and without deceit it reflects in a purely human way upon what it is to be a child.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
290;Supliciul disperării constă tocmai în faptul că nu poţi muri. De aceea, ea se apropie mai mult de starea de agonie, când zaci, te chinuieşti de moarte şi nu poţi muri. Astfel, a fi bolnav de moarte înseamnă a nu putea muri, totuşi nu ca şi când ar persista speranţa de a supravieţui, nu, ci absenţa speranţei constă în faptul că nu mai există nici măcar ultima speranţă, moartea. Atunci când pericolul suprem este moartea, ea speră în viaţă;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
291;Metaphorically speaking, a person's ideas must be the building he lives in - otherwise there is something terribly wrong.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
292;Theology sits rouged at the window and courts philosophy's favor, offering to sell her charms to it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
293;Philosophy cannot and should not give us an account of faith, but should understand itself and know just what it has indeed to offer, without taking anything away, least of all cheating people out of something by making them think it is nothing.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
294;She was a riddle, who mysteriously possessed her own solution, a secret, and what are all diplomats' secrets compared with this, an enigma, and what in all the world is so beautiful as the word that solves it?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
295;I think I have the courage to doubt everything;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
296;What philosophers say about actuality [Virkelighed] is often just as disappointing as it is when one reads on a sign in a secondhand shop: Pressing Done Here. If a person were to bring his clothes to be pressed, he would be duped, for the sign is merely for sale.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
297;Ulysses was not comely, but he was eloquent,Yet he fired two goddesses of the sea with love;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
298;They were not unfortunate girls who, as outcasts or in the belief that they were cast out by society, grieved wholesomely and intensely and, once in a while at times when the heart was too full, ventilated it in hate or forgiveness. No visible change took place in them;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

301;In fact one is tempted to ask whether there is a single man left ready, for once, to commit an outrageous folly.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
302;Only the lower natures forget themselves and become something new. Thus the butterfly has entirely forgotten that it was a caterpillar, perhaps it may in turn so entirely forget it was a butterfly that is becomes a fish.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
303;How empty life is and without meaning. - We bury a man, we follow him to the grave, we throw three spades of earth on him, we ride out in a coach, we ride home in a coach, we take comfort in the thought that a long life awaits us. But how long is threescore years and ten? Why not finish it at once?;Soren Kierkeggard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
304;The biggest danger, that of losing oneself, can pass off in the world as quietly as if it were nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
305;Deep within every man there lies the dread of being alone in the world, forgotten by God, overlooked among the household of millions upon millions.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
306;Spiritual superiority only sees the individual. But alas, ordinarily we human beings are sensual and, therefore, as soon as it is a gathering, the impression changes- we see something abstract, the crowd, and we become different. But in the eyes of God, the infinite spirit, all the millions that have lived and now live do not make a crowd, He only sees each individual.;Sören Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
307;I am convinced that God is love, this thought has for me a primitive lyrical validity. When it is present to me, I am unspeakably blissful, when it is absent, I long for it more vehemently than does the lover for his object;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
308;He who is educated by anxiety is educated by possibility… When such a person, therefore, goes out from the school of possibility, and knows more thoroughly than a child knows the alphabet that he demands of life absolutely nothing, and that terror, perdition, annihilation, dwell next door to every man, and has learned the profitable lesson that every dread which alarms may the next instant become a fact, he will then interpret reality differently…;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

312;خود بودن; ماجراجویانه است. مانند دیگران بودن; نسخه ی تقلیدی بودن; تبدیل شدن به یک عدد در میان جمعیت; بسیار آسان تر و امن تر است.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
313;The majority enjoy a young girl as they enjoy a glass of champagne, at one effervescent moment-oh, yes, that is really beautiful, and with many a young girl that is undoubtedly the most one can attain, but here there is more. If an individual is too fragile to stand clarity and transparency, well, then one enjoys what is unclear, but apparently she can stand it. The more devotedness one can bring to erotic love, the more interesting. This momentary enjoyment is a rape, even if not outwardly but nevertheless mentally, and in a rape there is only imagined enjoyment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
314;All men have a natural fear of making a mistake--by believing too well of a person. However, the error of believing too ill of a person is perhaps not feared, at least not in the same degree as the other.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
315;If we ask what poetry is we may say in general that it is a victory over the world;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

317;Spiritually, a man's thoughts must be the building in which he lives, otherwise it's wrong.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
318;Life's existential tasks have lost the interest of reality;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
319;Great Shakespeare!, you who can say everything, everything, everything exactly as it is – and yet why was this torment one you never gave voice to? Was it perhaps that you kept it to yourself, like the beloved whose name one still cannot bear the world to mention? For a poet buys this power of words to utter all the grim secrets of others at the cost of a little secret he himself cannot utter.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
320;In eternity it will be asked whether you may not have damaged a good thing, in order that you also might judge with them that did not know how to judge, but who possessed the crowd's strength, which in the temporal sense is significant, but to which eternity is wholly indifferent.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
321;No one shall be forgotten who was great in this world;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
322;Sitting calmly on a ship in fair weather is not a metaphor for having faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
323;The misfortune of our time is just this, that it has become simply nothing else but 'time', the temporal, which is impatient of hearing anything about eternity.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
324;My grief is my castle, which like an eagle's nest is built high up on the mountain peaks among the clouds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
325;ماذا لو أن كل شيء في هذا العالم هو عبارة عن سوء فهم؟ ماذا لو أن الضحك في الحقيقة هو عبارة عن بكاء؟;سورين كيركجارد;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
326;By seeing the multitude of people around it, by being busied with all sorts of worldly affairs, by being wise to the ways of the world, such a person forgets himself, in a divine sense forgets his own name, dares not believe in himself, finds being himself too risky, finds it much easier and safer to be like the others, to become a copy, a number, along with the crowd. Now this form of despair goes practically unnoticed in the world. Precisely by losing oneself in this way, such a person gains all that is required for a flawless performance in everyday life, yes, for making a great success out of life. Here there is no dragging of the feet, no difficulty with his self and its infinitizing, he is ground smooth as a pebble, as exchangeable as a coin of the realm. Far from anyone thinking him to be in despair, he is just what a human being ought to be. Naturally, the world has generally no understanding of what is truly horrifying.;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
327;The less support an idea has,the more fervently it must be believed in, so that a totally preposterous idea requires unflinching faith.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
328;در حالی که زندگی را فقط با نگاه به گذشته می‌توان درک کرد; باید آن را با نگاه به آینده ادامه داد;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
329;Even though it be true that the conception of God is absolute help, it is also the only help which is absolutely capable of revealing to man his own helplessness.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
330;Those who bore others are the plebians, the mass, the endless train of humanity in general. Those who bore themselves are the elect, the nobility;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
331;It isn't at all difficult for philosophy to begin. Far from it: it begins with nothing and can accordingly always begin. What seems so difficult to philosophy and the philosophers is to stop.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
332;To be isolated is always to assert oneself numerically;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
333;Thus ressentiment becomes the constituent principle of want of character, which from utter wretchedness tries to sneak itself a position, all the time safeguarding itself by conceding that it is less than nothing. The ressentiment which results from want of character can never understand that eminent distinction really is distinction. Neither does it understand itself by recognizing distinction negatively (as in the case of ostracism) but wants to drag it down, wants to belittle it so that it really ceases to be distinguished. And ressentiment not only defends itself against all existing forms of distinction but against that which is still to come.The ressentiment which is establishing itself is the process of levelling.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
334;The levelling process is the victory of abstraction over the individual. The levelling process in modern times, corresponds, in reflection, to fate in antiquity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
335;To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of evil is to fear. By the decision to choose hope one decides infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
336;These words were spoken by Him to whom, according to His own statement, is given all power in heaven and on earth. You who hear me must consider within yourselves whether you will bow before his authority or not, accept and believe the words or not. But if you do not wish to do so, then for heaven's sake do not go and accept the words because they are clever or profound or wonderfully beautiful, for that is a mockery of God.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
337;The humorous self-sufficiency of genius is the unity of a modest resignation in the world and a proud elevation above the world: of being an unnecessary superfluity and a precious ornament. If the genius is an artist, then he accomplishes his work of art, but neither he nor his work of art has a telos outside him. Or he is an author, who abolishes every teleological relation to his environment and humorously defines himself as a poet. Lyrical art has certainly no telos outside it: and whether a man writes a short lyric or folios, it makes no difference to the quality of the nature of his work. The lyrical author is only concerned with his production, enjoys the pleasure of producing, often perhaps only after pain and effort;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
338;Boredom is the only continuity the ironist has.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
339;"The genius differs from us men in being able to endure isolation, his rank as a genius is proportionate to his strength for enduring isolation, whereas we men are constantly in need of ""the others,"" the herd";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
340;The bird keeps silent and suffers. However much heartache it has, it keeps silent. It does not complain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
341;Man is the synthesis of the infinite and the finite, the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
342;one cannot seek for what he knows, and it seems equally impossible for him to seek for what he does not know. For what a man knows he cannot seek, since he knows it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
343;The task is not to find the lovable object, but to find the object before you lovable – whether given or chosen – and to be able to continue finding this one lovable, no matter how that person changes. To love is to love the person one sees.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
344;Therefore, truth is not a matter of knowing this or that but of being in the truth.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
345;"انسانى كه در شادى و غم زندگى چنان غرق مى شود كه سراسر عمرش از ""نفْس"" و ""خويشتنِ"" خود آگاه نمى شود، زندگى اش به هدر رفته است.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
346;"مردم از کنار بزرگ ترین خطر، که همانا از دست دادنِ ""خویشتنِ"" خود است، چنان بی سر و صدا می گذرند که انگار هیچ اهمیتی ندارد؛ از دست دادنِ هر چیز دیگر، مثل دست و پا، یک پنج دلاری، همسر و غیره، بیشتر مورد توجهشان قرار می گیرد.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
347;...for our times are not satisfied with faith and not even with the miracle of changing water into wine - they 'go right on,' changing wine into water.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
348;Courage is life's only measure.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
349;Our age reminds one of the dissolution of the Greek city-state: Everything goes on as usual and yet there is no longer anyone who believes in it. The invisible spiritual bond which gives it validity, no longer exists, and so the whole age is at once comic and tragic--tragic because it is perishing, comic because it goes on.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
350;I am courteous enough to assume that everyone in this so aesthetically voluptuous age, so potent and aroused that conception occurs as easily as with the partridge which, Aristotle says, needs only to hear the voice of the cock or its flight overhead - to assume that at the mere sound of the word 'concealment' everyone can easily shake a dozen romances and comedies from his sleeve.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
351;To believe is indeed to lose the understanding in order to gain God.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
352;Sin is: in despair not wanting to be oneself before God.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
353;When I get up in the morning I go straight back to bed again. I feel best in the evening, the moment I dowse the candle, pull the eiderdown over my head. I raise myself up once more, look about the room with an indescribable peace of mind, and then it's goodnight, down under the eiderdown.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
354;One can very well eat lettuce before its heart has been formed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
355;وفي حالة ذلك الشاب الغني الذي التقى به المسيح في الطريق وباع كل بضاعته وأعطى الفقير-فإننا ينبغي أن نمجده كما نمجد كل شئ عظيم-وإن كنا لا نستطيع أن نفهمه دون أن نكدح;سرن كيركجور,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
356;No, like worldly contempt, worldly honor is a whirlpool, a play of confused forces, an illusory moment in the flux of opinions. It is a sense-deception, as when a swarm of insects at a distance seem to the eye like one body;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
357;A superstitious belief which embraces an error keeps the possibility open that the truth may come to arouse it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
358;The true knight of faith is always absolute isolation, the false knight is sectarian. This sectarianism is an attempt to leap away from the narrow path of the paradox and become a tragic hero at a cheap price. The tragic hero expresses the universal and sacrifices himself for it. The sectarian punchinello, instead of that, has a private theatre, i.e. several good friends and comrades who represent the universal just about as well as the beadles in The Golden Snuffbox represent justice. The knight of faith, on the contrary, is the paradox, is the individual, absolutely nothing but the individual, without connections or pretensions. This is the terrible thing which the sectarian manikin cannot endure. For instead of learning from this terror that he is not capable of performing the great deed and then plainly admitting it (an act which I cannot but approve, because it is what I do) the manikin thinks that by uniting with several other manikins he will be able to do it. But that is quite out of the question. In the world of spirit no swindling is tolerated.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
359;My opinion is, of course, completely my own. I would not impose it on anyone else and decline any pressure to change it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
360;Reflection is and remains the hardest creditor in existence;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
361;People commonly travel the world over to see rivers and mountains, new stars, garish birds, freak fish, grotesque breeds of human;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
362;What is decisive is that with God everything is possible. . . This is indeed a generally recognized truth, which is commonly expressed in this way, but the critical decision does not come until a person is brought to his extremity, when, humanly speaking, there is no possibility. Then the question is whether he will believe that for God everything is possible...;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
363;If I had a humble spirit in my service who, when I asked for a glass of water, brought me the world's costliest wines blended in a chalice, I should dismiss him, in order to teach him that my pleasure consists, not in what I enjoy, but in having my own way.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
364;What we call worldliness simply consists of such people who, if one may so express it, pawn themselves to the world.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
365;The reward of the good man is to be allowed to worship in truth.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
366;How to be listed as a dream in the mind of a young girl is an art, going out is a masterpiece.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
367;It is now my intention to draw out from the story of Abraham the dialecticalconsequences inherent in it, expressing them in the form ofproblemata, in order to seewhat a tremendous paradox faith is, a paradox which is capable of transforming amurder into a holy act well-pleasing to God, a paradox which gives Isaac back toAbraham, which no thought can master, because faith begins precisely there wherethinking leaves off.;Kierkegaard, Søren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
368;How dreadful boredom is — how dreadfully boring;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
369;As the calm lake stems from the deep spring that no eye saw, so too a person's love has a still deeper ground, in God's love. If there were no gushing spring at the bottom, if Hod were not love, then neither would there be the little lake nor either a person's love. As the calm lake stems darkly from the deep spring, so a person's love originate mysteriously in God's. As the calm lake indeed invites you to contemplate it, yet with the darkness of the reflection prevents you from seeing through it, so does love's mysterious origin in God's love prevent you from seeing its ground. When you think you see it, it is a reflection that deceives you, as if what only hides the deeper ground were itself the ground.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
370;The person whose joy is dependant upon certain conditions is not himself joyful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
371;To stand on one leg and prove God's existence is a very different thing from going on one's knees and thanking Him.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
372;The more consciousness there is in such a sufferer who in despair wills to be himself, the more his despair intensifies and becomes demonic. It usually originates as follows. A self that in despair wills to be itself is pained in some distress or other that does not allow itself to be taken away from or separated from his concrete self. So now he makes precisely this torment the object of all his passion, and finally it becomes a demonic rage. By now, even if God in heaven and all the angels offered to help him out of it- no, he does not want that, now it is too late. Once he would gladly have given everything to be rid of this agony, but he was kept waiting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
373;Besides, Christianity is not a doctrine to be taught, but rather a life to be lived.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
374;الحق قوة; لكننا لا نراه هكذا إلا في حالات نادرة. لأنه حق يتألم دائماً ويجب أن يُهزم طالما هو حق· أما عندما ينتصر هذا الحق فنرى الآخرين ينصتون إليه· لماذا؟ ألأنه حق؟ لا;" فلو كان لهذا السبب لانضموا إليه عندما كان يتألم أيضاً· ولهذا فإن عدم انضمامهم إليه ليس للقوة التي يمتلكها؛ إنهم ينضمون إليه بعد أن يصبح قوة لأن الآخرين يكونون قد سبقوهم لذلك.";Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
375;Imagination is what providence uses to take men captive in actuality, in existence, in order to get them far enough out, or within, or down into existence. And when imagination has helped them get as far out as they should be - then actuality genuinely begins.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
376;"Something wonderful has happened to me. I was carried up into the seventh heaven. There all the gods sat assembled. By special grace I was granted the favor of a wish. ""Will you,"" said Mercury, ""have youth, or beauty, or power, or a long life, or the most beautiful maiden, or any of the other glories we have in the chest? Choose, but only one thing."" For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed myself to the gods as follows: ""Most honorable contemporaries, I choose this one thing, that I may always have the laugh on my side."" Not one of the gods said a word, on the contrary, they all began to laugh. Hence, I concluded that my request was granted, and found that the gods knew how to express themselves with great taste";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
377;Love has many mysteries, and this first infatuation is also a mystery, even if a minor one - most people who rush into it get engaged or indulge in other foolish pranks, and then it's all over with the twinkling of an eye and they don't know what they have conquered or what they have lost.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
378;All distinctions between the many different kinds of love are essentially abolished by Christianity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
379;So now begins the first war with Cordelia' in which I retreat and thereby teach her to be victorious as she pursues me. I continually fall back, and in this backward movement I teach her to know through me all the powers of erotic love, its turbulent thoughts' its passion, what longing is, and hope, and impatient expectancy. As I perform this set of steps before her' all this will correspondingly in her' It is a triumphant procession in which I am leading her, and I myself am just as much the one who dithyrambically sings praises to her victory as I am the one who shows the way. She will gain courage to believe in erotic love, to believe it is an etemal force, when she sees its dominion over me, sees my movements. She will believe me, partly because I rely on my artistry, and partly because at the bottom of what I am doing there is truth. If that were not the case, she would not believe me. With my every move, she becomes stronger and stronger;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
380;The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard, nor read about, nor seen, but, if one will, are to be lived.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
381;ومن المفترض أن فهم هيجل شئ صعب;على أن فهم إبراهيم شئ تافه;وتجاوز هيجل يعد معجزة;أما تجاوز إبراهيم فأسهل شئ على الإطلاق;أما أنا-فمن ناحيتي-قد كرست وقتاً طويلاً لفهم الفلسفة الهيجلية;ولكن عندما تكون هناك فقرات معينة لا أستطيع أن أفهمها على الرغم من المشقة التي أخذت بها نفسي;فإنني من الجرأة بحيث أعتقد أن هيجل نفسه لم يكن واضحاً تمام الوضوح;سرن كيركجور,;;;;;;;;;;;;
382;But we are curious about the result, just as we are curious about the way a book turns out. We do not want to know anything about the anxiety, the distress, the paradox. We carry on an esthetic flirtation with the result. It arrives just as unexpectedly but also just as effortlessly as a prize in a lottery, and when we have heard the result, we have built ourselves up.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
383;The supreme paradox of all thought is the attempt to discover something that thought cannot think.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
384;Los recuerdos, con el tiempo, se vuelven un precioso tema de conversación y en su alma causará más efecto aquello que conmovió tan profundamente su sentir.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
385;Este un punct de vedere superficial (al unui om care probabil n-a văzut vreodată un om disperat, nici măcar pe sine însuşi) atunci când se spune despre un disperat, de parcă aceasta i-ar fi pedeapsa, că el se distruge pe sine. Căci tocmai aceasta vrea cu disperare şi, spre durerea sa, nu poate, fiindcă prin disperare a fost dat pradă flacărilor ceva ce nu poate arde sau nu poate să fie mistuit, sinele. O fetişcană disperă din dragoste, deci disperă pentru pierderea iubitului, care a murit sau i-a devenit infidel. Aceasta nu este o disperare care s-a manifestat, ci ea disperă pentru ea însăşi. Acest sine al ei, de care s-ar fi eliberat sau pe care l-ar fi pierdut la modul cel mai încântător cu putinţă dacă ar fi devenit iubita «lui». Acest sine este acum pentru ea o calamitate, pentru că trebuie să fie un sine fără «el»;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

389;Equally unthinkable among young men of today is a truly religious renunciation of the world, adhered to with daily self-denial. On the other hand almost any theological student is capable of something far more wonderful. He could found a society with the sole object of saving all those who are lost. The age of great and good actions is past, the present is the age of anticipation when even recognition is received in advance.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

391;she does not suspect how much reason I have for deprecating all sympathy.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
392;An increased power of reflection like an increased knowledge only adds to man's affliction, and above all it is certain that for the individual as for the generation no task is more difficult than to escape from the temptations of reflection, simply because they are so dialectical and the result of one clever discovery may give the whole question a new turn, because at any moment reflection is capable of explaining everything quite differently and allowing one some way of escape;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

394;Not merely in the realm of commerce but in the world of ideas as well our age is organizing a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
395;The dialectic of antiquity tended towards leadership (the great individual and the masses--the free man and the slaves);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
396;But the present generation, wearied by its chimerical efforts, relapses into complete indolence. Its condition is that of a man who has only fallen asleep towards morning: first of all come great dreams, then a feeling of laziness, and finally a witty or clever excuse for remaining in bed.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

408;"It is (to describe it figuratively) as if an author were to make a slip of the pen, and as if this clerical error became conscious of being such. Perhaps this was no error but in a far higher sense was an essential part of the whole exposition. It is, then, as if this clerical error were to revolt against the author, out of hatred for him, were to forbid him to correct it, and were to say, ""No, I will not be erased, I will stand as a witness against thee, that thou art a very poor writer.";Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
409;"Thus when the ambitious man, whose slogan was ""Either Caesar or nothing"", does not become Caesar, he is in despair over it. But this signifies something else, namely, that precisely because he did not become Caesar he now cannot bear to be himself. Consequently he is not in despair over the fact that he did not become Caesar, but he is in despair over himself for the fact that he did not become Caesar.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410;He follows his heart's desire, but having found what he sought he wanders round to everyone's door with his song and speech, so that all can admire the hero as he does, be proud of the hero as he is.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
411;You should therefore say: alone in one's boat, alone with one's care, alone with one's despair, which one is craven enough to want rather to keep than submit to the pain of being healed.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
412;Satan's despair is absolute because Satan, as pure spirit, is pure consciousness, and for Satan (and all men in his predicament) every increase in consciousness is an increase in despair.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
413;Oh Thou that givest both the beginning and the completion, give Thou victory in the day of need so that what neither a man's burning wish nor his determined resolution may attain to, may be granted unto him in the sorrowing of repentance: to will only one thing.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
414;My depression is the most faithful mistress I have known -- no wonder, then, that I return the love.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
415;There is nothing so seductive to a girl as to be loved by a poetic-depressive type. And if she is vain enough to deceive herself into thinking that she loves him faithfully by clinging to him instead of giving him up, then her task will be easy. She will enjoy both the distinction and the good conscience of being faithful, and at the same time the most finely distilled romantic love. God save everyone from such faithfulness!;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
416;When the child must be weaned, the mother too is not without sorrow at the thought that she and the child are separated more and more, that the child which first lay under her heart and later reposed upon her breast will be so near to her no more.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
417;In association with the ordinary run of men I have had but little to win or to lose ... My companions have with few exceptions exerted no marked influence on me ... So I am standing once more at the point where I must begin in another way. I shall now try to look calmly at myself and begin to act inwardly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
418;I need the enchantment of creative work to help me forget life’s mean pettinesses.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
419;Precisely because a human being has the ability to speak, for this very reason the ability to keep silent is an art;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
420;The bird keeps silent and waits: it knows, or rather it fully and firmly believes, that everything takes place at its appointed time. Therefore the bird waits, but it knows that it is not granted to it to know the hour or the day;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
421;If the ethical - that is, social morality - is the highest and if there is in a person no residual incommensurability in some way such that this incommensurability is not evil then no categories are needed other than what Greek philosophy had... and what their wisdom amounts to is the beautiful proposition that basically everything is the same.;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
422;It is a positive starting point for philosophy when Aristotle says that philosophy begins with wonder, not as in our day with doubt. Moreover the world will learn that the thing is not to begin with the negative, and the reason why it has succeeded up to the present is that it has never really given itself over to the negative, and so has never seriously done what it said. Its doubt is mere child's play.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

426;What every man can do is to make the movement of infinite resignation, and I for my part would not hesitate to pronounce everyone cowardly who wishes to make himself believe he can not do it. With faith it is a different matter. But what every man has not a right to do, is to make others believe that faith is something lowly, or that it is an easy thing, whereas it is the greatest and the hardest.

434;The more he needs God, the more deeply he comprehends he is in need of God, and then the more he in his need presses forward to God, the more perfect he is... To need God is nothing to be ashamed of but is perfection itself.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
435;The whole world can be divided into those who write and those who do not write. Those who write represent despair, and those who read disapprove of it and believe that they have a superior wisdom – and yet, if they were able to write, they would write the same thing. Basically they are all equally despairing, but when one does not have the opportunity to become important with his despair, then it is hardly worth the trouble to despair and show it. Is this what it is to have conquered despair?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
436;I see it perfectly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
437;As the ironist does not have the new within his power, it might be asked how he destroys the old, and to this it must be answered: he destroys the given actuality by the given actuality itself.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
438;The follower aspires with all his strength to be what he admires. And then, remarkably enough, even though he lives amongst a 'Christian people,' he incurs the same peril as he did when it was dangerous to openly confess Christ. And because of the follower's life, it will become evident who the admirers are, for the admirers will become agitated with him. Even these words will disturb many - but then they must likewise belong to the admirers.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
439;A young girl is excused for not being able to give reasons, they say she lives in her feelings. It is different with me. Generally, I have so many and usually mutually contradictory reasons that, for that reason, it is impossible for me to give reasons.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
440;Christian heroism, and indeed one perhaps sees little enough of that, is to risk unreservedly being oneself, an individual human being, this specific individual human being alone before God, alone in this enormous exertion and this enormous accountability;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
441;So it isn't I who am master of my life, I am just one of the threads to be woven into life's calico! Well then, even if I cannot spin, I can at least cut the thread in two.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

444;Many and various are the things to which a man may feel himself drawn, but one thing there is to which no man ever felt himself drawn in any way, that is, to suffering and humiliation. This we men think we ought to shun as far as possible, and in any case that we must be compelled to it.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
445;It takes a purely human courage to renounce the whole temporal realm in order to gain eternity, but this I do gain and in all eternity can never renounce—it is a self-contradiction. But it takes a paradoxical and humble courage to grasp the whole temporal realm now by virtue of the absurd, and this is the courage of faith.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

447;It is in your power to review your life, to look at things you saw before, but from another point of view;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
448;It is the thought, not the incidentals of expression, that essentially makes an exposition unpopular. A systematic ribbon and button maker can become unpopular but essentially is not at all, inasmuch as he does not mean much by the very odd things he says (alas, and this is a popular art!). Socrates, on the other hand, was the most unpopular in Greece because he said the same thing as the simplest person but meant infinitely much by it. To be able to stick to one thing, to stick to it with ethical passion and undauntedness of spirit, to see the intrinsic duplexity of this one thought with the same impartiality, and at one and the same time to see the most profound earnestness and the greatest jest, the deepest tragedy and highest comedy―this is unpopular in any age for anyone who has not realized that immediacy is over. But neither can what is essentially unpopular be learned by rote. More on that later.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
449;My soul is so heavy that no longer can any thought sustain it, no wingbeat lift it up into the ether. If it moves, it only sweeps along the ground like the low flight of birds when a thunderstorm is brewing.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
450;Fools and young men prate about everything being possible for a man. That, however, is a great error. Spiritually speaking, everything is possible, but in the world of the finite there is much which is not possible.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

455;Silence is the snare of the demon, and the more one keeps silent, the more terrifying the demon becomes.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
456;For there he stands, the emissary from the kingdom of sighs, the elected favourite of suffering, the apostle of sorrow, the silent friend of pain, the unhappy lover of memory, confounded in his memory by the light of hope, deceived in his hope by the shadows of memory. His head is heavy, his knees are weak, yet he rests on none but himself. He is faint, yet how powerful! His eyes seem not to have shed, but to have drunk, many tears;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
457;Were I to wish for anything I would not wish for wealth and power, but for the passion of the possible, that eye which everywhere, ever young, ever burning, sees possibility. Pleasure disappoints, not possibility.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

460;Ceea ce îmi lipseşte de fapt e să îmi lămuresc mie însumi ce trebuie să fac, nu ce trebuie să cunosc, decât în măsura în care cunoaşterea precede în mod necesar orice act. Important e să înţeleg menirea mea, să văd ce vrea de fapt Dumnezeirea ca eu să fac;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
461;There was a young man favorably endowed as an Alcibiades. He lost his way in the world. In his need he looked about for a Socrates but found none among his contemporaries. Then he requested the gods to change him into one. But now--he who had been so proud of being an Alcibiades was so humiliated and humbled by the gods' favor that, just when he received what he could be proud of, he felt inferior to all.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
462;And the man who learns most from the levelling and himself becomes greatest does not become an outstanding man or hero--that would only impede the levelling process, which is rigidly consistent to the end--he himself prevents that from happening because he has understood the meaning of levelling;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
463;But it was not to remain thus. Still once more Abraham was to be tried. He had fought with that cunning power which invents everything, with that alert enemy which never slumbers, with that old man who outlives all things–he had fought with Time and preserved his faith. Now all the terror of the strife was concentrated in one instant.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
464;If Hegel had written the whole of his logic and then said, in the preface or some other place, that it was merely an experiment in thought in which he had even begged the question in many places, then he would certainly have been the greatest thinker who had ever lived. As it is, he is merely comic.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
465;Yet Abraham believed, and believed for this life. Yea, if his faith had been only for a future life, he surely would have cast everything away in order to hasten out of this world to which he did not belong. But Abraham's faith was not of this sort, if there be such a faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
466;If a man had a little button sewn on the inner pocket of his coat 'on principle' his otherwise unimportant and quite serviceable action would become charged with importance--it is not improbable that it would result in the formation of a society.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
467;On principle' a man can do anything, take part in anything and himself remain inhuman and indeterminate. 'On principle' a man may interest himself in the founding of a brothel, and the same man can 'on principle' assist in the publication of a new Hymn book because it is supposed to be the great need of the times. But it would be as unjustifiable to conclude from the first fact that he was debauched as it would, perhaps, be to conclude from the second that he read or sang hymns.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
468;Job endured everything — until his friends came to comfort him, then he grew impatient.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
469;With every increase in the degree of consciousness, and in proportion to that increase, the intensity of despair increases: the more consciousness the more intense the despair.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
470;As a genius St. Paul cannot be compared with either Plato or Shakespeare, as a coiner of beautiful similes he comes pretty low down in the scale, as a stylist his name is quite obscure--and as an upholsterer: well, I frankly admit I have no idea how to place him.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
471;An Apostle can never come to himself in such a way that he becomes conscious of his apostolic calling as a factor in the development of his life. Apostolic calling is a paradoxical factor, which from first to last in his life stands paradoxically outside his personal identity with himself as the definite person he is.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

477;An illusion can never be destroyed directly, and only by indirect means can it be radically removed... That is, one must approach from behind the person who is under an illusion.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
478;The merman does not want to seduce Agnes, although previously he had seduced many. He is no longer a merman, or, if one so will, he is a miserable merman who already has long been sitting on the floor of the sea and sorrowing. However, he knows (as the legend in fact teaches), that he can be delivered by the love of an innocent girl. But he has a bad conscience with respect to girls and does not dare to approach them. Then he sees Agnes. Already many a time when he was hidden in the reeds he had seen her walking on the shore. Her beauty, her quiet occupation with herself, fixes his attention upon her ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
479;What is a poet ? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music…And people crowd around the poet and say to him, Sing again soon—in other words, may new sufferings torture your soul, and may your lips continue to be formed as before, because your screams would only alarm us, but the music is charming.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
480;If anything is to be done, one must try to introduce Christianity into Christendom.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
481;If anyone thinks he has faith and yet is indifferent towards this possession, is neither cold nor hot, he can be certain that he does not have faith. If anyone thinks he is Christian and yet is indifferent towards his being a Christian, then he really is not one at all. What would we think of a man who affirmed that he was in love and also that it was a matter of indifference to him?;Kierkegaard, Søren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
482;Only by investing and speaking yourvision with passion can the truth, oneway or the other, finally penetrate thereluctance of the world.;SOREN KIERKEGAARD;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
483;I lack altogether patience to live. I cannot see the grass grow, but since I cannot I don’t feel at all inclined to.

I haven’t noticed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
484;What shall it profit the sick man to imagine himself, as all men do, to be well, if the physician says he is sick!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
485;The present state of the world and the whole of life is diseased. If I were a doctor and were asked for my advice, I would reply: Create silence! The Word of God cannot be heard in the noisy world of today. And even if it were blazoned forth with all the panoply of noise so that it could be heard in the midst of all the other noise, then it would no longer be the Word of God. Therefore create Silence.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
486;The profundity of Christianity is that Christ is both our redeemer and our judge, not that one is our redeemer and another is our judge, for then we certainly come under judgement, but that the redeemer and the judge are the same.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
487;The person who lives in the ethical sphere lives intentionally, intensively. Such a person possesses character and conviction, and is thus willing to sacrifice himself for something greater than oneself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

489;The only fundamental basis for understanding is that one himself becomes what he understands and one understands only in proportion to becoming himself that which he understands.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
490;Thus to get the princess, to livewith her joyfully and happily day in and day out (for it is also conceivable thatthe knight of resignation might get the princess, but that his soul had discerned theimpossibility of their future happiness), thus to live joyfully and happily everyinstant by virtue of the absurd, every instant to see the sword hanging over thehead of the beloved, and yet to find repose in the pain of resignation, but joy byvirtue of the absurd—this is marvellous.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
491;Battle day and night against the guile of oblivion...;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
492;Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breath forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
493;At vove er at miste fodfæstet et kort øjeblik - ikke at vove er at miste sig selv.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
494;The more consciousness there is in such a sufferer who in despair wills to be himself, the more his despair intensifies and becomes demonic. It usually originates as follows. A self that in despair wills to be itself is pained in some distress or other that does not allow itself to be taken away from or separated from his concrete self. So now he makes precisely this torment the object of all his passion, and finally it becomes a demonic age. By now, even if God in heaven and all the angels offered to help him out of it- no, he does not want that, now it is too late. Once he would gladly have given everything to be rid of this agony, but he was kept waiting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
495;An individual in despair despairs over something. So it seems for a moment, but only for a moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
496;A man’s life is wasted when he lives on, so deceived by the joys of life or by its sorrows, that he never becomes decisively conscious of himself as spirit, as self, that is, he never is aware in the deepest sense that there is a God.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
497;Whatever can be the meaning of this life? If we divide mankind into two large classes, we can say that one works for a living, the other has no need to. But working for one’s living can’t be the meaning of life;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
498;In the deepest sense you shall make yourself nothing, become nothing before God, learn to be silent. In this silence is the beginning, which is to seek first God's kingdom;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
499;A passionately tumultuous age wants to overthrow everything, subvert everything. A revolutionary but passionless and reflecting age changes the manifestation of power into a dialectical sleight-of-hand, letting everything remain but slyly defrauding it of its meaning;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
500;And although this (marital love) cannot be portrayed artistically, then let your consolation be, as it is mine, that we are not to read about or listen to or look at what is highest and the most beautiful in life, but are, if you please, to live it. Therefore, when I readily admit that romantic love lends itself much better to artistic portrayal than marital love, this does not at all mean that it is less esthetic than the other - on the contrary, it is more esthetic.;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
501;Hope is passion for what is possible.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
502;Mükemmel aşk, insanın kendisini mutsuz edecek kişiyi sevmesidir.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

505;Only the Eternal is always appropriate and always present, is always true. Only the Eternal applies to each human being, whatever his age may be.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
506;I have often discovered how profitable it is to give sorrow an ethical expression, not to erase the aesthetic factor in sorrow but to master it ethically. As long as sorrow is quiet and humble, I do not fear it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
507;In spiritlessness there is no anxiety. It is too happy for that, too content, and too spiritless. But this is a very pitiable reason, and paganism differs from spiritlessness in the former being definable as directed toward spirit and the latter as directed from spirit. Paganism is, if you will, the absence of spirit and thus differs far from spiritlessness. Paganism is in this respect much to be preferred. Spiritlessness is spirit’s stagnation and ideality’s caricature. Spiritlessness is accordingly not literally dumb when it comes to repetition by rote, but it is dumb [has lost its sense] in the way in which it is said of salt that it has lost its flavor† and when one asks then how it can be salted.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
508;But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

514;Every individual, however original he may be, is still a child of God, of his age, of his nation, of his family and friends. Only thus is he truly himself. If in all this relativity he tries to be the absolute, then he becomes ridiculous.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

516;In the first case, he personally enjoyed the esthetic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
517;It is really true what philosophy tells us, that life must be understood backwards. But with this, one forgets the second proposition, that it must be lived forwards. A proposition which, the more it is subjected to careful thought, the more it ends up concluding precisely that life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
518;<...> tikėjimą turėti - pavydėtina dalia, net jei niekas apie tai nežinotų. (7-8);Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
519;...The discrepancy is that the ethical self should be found immanently in the despair, that the individual won himself by persisting in the despair. True, he has used something within the category of freedom, choosing himself, which seem to remove the difficulty, one that presumably has not struck many, since philosophically doubting everything and then finding the true beginning goes one, two, three. But that does not help. In despairing, I use myself to despair, and therefore I can indeed despair of everything by myself. But if I do this, I cannot come back by myself. It is in this moment of decision that the individual needs divine assistance, whereas it is quite correct that in order to be at this point one must first have understood the existence-relation between the aesthetic and the ethical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

525;I would rather be a swineherd at Amagerbro and be understood by the swine than be a poet and be misunderstood by people.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

527;استمع إلى صراخ الأم وهي تضع وليدها; انظر إلى صراع الرجل مع الموت وهو يلفظ أنفاسه الأخيرة; ثم اخبرني:هل من يبدأ هكذا وينتهي كذلك; يكون قد خُلق للسعادة؟!;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
528;That’s why my soul always reverts to the Old Testament and to Shakespeare. There at least one feels that it’s human beings talking. There people hate, people love, people murder their enemy and curse his descendants through all generations, there people sin.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
529;The best proof adduced of the wretchedness of life is that derived from contemplating its glory.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
530;What is the New Testament? A handbook for those who are to be sacrificed.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
531;Truth always rests with the minority … because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory, formed by the gangs who have no opinion.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
532;I raise myself up once more, look about the room with an indescribable peace of mind, and then it’s goodnight, down under the eiderdown.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
533;For as the Good is only a single thing, so all ways lead to the Good, even the false ones: when the repentant one follows the same way back.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
534;ღმერთის რწმენა ადამიანში უკიდურესი სასოწარკვეთილებისა და თავზარის პირობებში იღვიძებს;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
535;Because of the a priori element in intention, good intentions are so tempting - compared with a successive unfolding in time - and have so often in them some narcotic which develops an inner gaze instead of a resilience that begets energy.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
536;For whether it be the lightly armed desire of youth which it is presumed will press forward to victory, or whether it be the mature man s determination that will fight its way through life, they both count on having a long time at their disposal. They presuppose, in the plans for their efforts, a generation or at least a number of years, and therefore they waste a great deal of time and on that account the whole thing so readily ends in delusion.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

538;Tenía una confidente íntima -mi melancolía-, y en medio de mi alegría, en medio de mi trabajo, ella me atrae, me llama a un lado aunque físicamente yo permanezca en el lugar. Es la más fiel amante que haya conocido.... Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
539;Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
540;Besides my other numerous circle of acquaintances I have one more intimate confidant – my melancholy. In the midst of my joy, in the midst of my work, he waves to me, calls me to one side, even though physically I stay put. My melancholy is the most faithful mistress I have known;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

542;One becomes weary only of what is new.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
543;How barren is my soul and thought, and yet incessantly tormented by vacuous, rapturous and agonizing birth pangs! Is my spirit to be forever tongue-tied? Must I always babble? What I need is a voice as penetrating as the glance of Lynceus, terrifying as the sigh of the giants, persistent as a sound of nature, mocking as a frost-chilled gust of wind, malicious as Echo's callous scorn, with a compass from the deepest bass to the most melting chest-notes, modulating from the whisper of gentle holiness to the violent fury of rage. That is what I need to get air, to give expression to what is on my mind, to stir the bowels of my wrath and of my sympathy. But my voice is only hoarse like the cry of a gull, or dying away like the blessing upon the lips of the dumb.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

551;إبراهيم أيها الأب المبجل ! لست بحاجة في سيرك من جبل المريا إلى بيتك إلى نشيد للثناء عليك قد يجلب إليك العزاء على خسارتك-فقد ربحت كل شئ واحتفظت بإسحق-ألم يكن الأمر كذلك؟ إن الربّ لم يأخذه منك..;سرن كيركجور,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

553;فهاهنا كان إبراهيم فريسة للشكّ;سرن كيركجور,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
554;Kierkegaard stands against every form of thinking that bypasses the individual or enables the individual to escape his responsibility before God. He also made an absolute demand that idea should be translated into existence (being and doing), which is exactly what his contemporaries, in his opinion, failed to do: Most systematizers stand in the same relation to their systems as the man who builds a great castle and lives in an adjoining shack;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
555;... he will seek vainly to the right and to the left and in the newspapers for a guarantee that he has actually been amused.For a sophisticated person, on the other hand, who is still unembarrassed enough to dare to be amused all by himself, who has enough self-confidence to know, without seeking advice from anyone else, whether he has been amused, farce will perhaps have a very special meaning, in that now with the spaciousness of abstraction and now with the presentation of a tangible actuality, it will affect his mood differently.He will, of course refrain from bringing a fixed and definite mood with him so that everything affects him in relation to that mood. He will have perfected his mood, in that he will be able to keep himself in a condition where no particular mood is present, but where all moods are possible.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
556;In order to help another effectively I must understand more than he – yet first of all surely I must understand what he understands. If I do not know that, my greater understanding will be of no help to him. If, however, I am disposed to plume myself on my greater understanding, it is because I am vain or proud, so that at bottom, instead of benefiting him, I want to be admired.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

561;Sâu thẳm trong đáy lòng mỗi người vẫn hiện hữu một niềm khoắc khoải về nỗi cô đơn giữa thế gian, sợ bị Chúa lãng quên, sợ bị chìm lắng giữa triệu triệu người. Dù tự trấn an mình bằng cách dựa vào thân bằng quyến thuộc thì lòng vẫn cứ hoang mang, khó mà dối mình rằng mối lo ấy đã được cất bỏ.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
562;هل كان ذلك هو حالك؟ عندما أبصرت بعيداً قضاء الله العسير يقترب منك-ألم تقل للجبال فلتهوي فوقي-وللتلال زمّليني؟ ألم تتحرك قدماك متباطئة على الطريق;مشتاقة إلى الدرب القديم؟;سرن كيركجور,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

567;It costs a man just as much or even more to go to hell than to come to heaven. Narrow, exceedingly narrow is the way to perdition!;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
568;One must see how laughter is feared above all other sorts of attack, how even a man who had boldly encountered mortal peril for a cause that did not concern him, would hardly hesitate to betray father and mother in case the danger were laughter.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
569;All lives end, but not all conclude.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
570;كل شئ يضيع الآن-الذكرى المجيدة التي سيحفظها الجنس البشري-الوعد-ذلك الكنز المجيد العتيد الذي كان عمرُه من عمر الإيمان في قلب إبراهيم-ثمرة حياة إبراهيم-التي زكّتها الصلوات-وأنضجتها المجاهدات-هذه الثمرة ينبغي أن تنتزع الآن قبل الأوان-وأن تبقى بلا مغزى-فما مغزى أن يضحي بإسحق؟;سرن كيركجور,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

575;It is not what happens to me that makes me great, but what I do.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
576;What is youth? A dream. What is love? The dream’s content.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
577;But Abraham believed, therefore he was young;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
578;But it is just as useless for a man to want first of all to decide the externals and after that the fundamentals as it is for a cosmic body, thinking to form itself, first of all to decide the nature of its surface, to what bodies it should turn its light, to which its dark side, without first letting the harmony of centrifugal and centripetal forces realize [*realisere*] its existence [*Existents*] and letting the rest come of itself. One must learn first to know himself before knowing anything else (γνῶθι σε αυτόν). Not until a man has inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
579;خوشبختانه چیزها آن‌طور که کشیش موعظه می‌کند اتفاق نمی‌افتند زیرا در زندگی لااقل معنایی وجود دارد اما در موعظۀ کشیش هیچ معنایی نیست.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
580;If I could forget you! Is my love then a work of memory? Even if time expunged everything from its tablets, expunged even memory itself, my relation to you would stay just as alive, you would still not be forgotten. If I could forget you! What then should I remember? For after all, I have forgotten myself in order to remember you: so if I forgot you I would come to remember myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
581;The most painful state of being is remembering the future, particularly one you can never have.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
582;By comparison with a passionate age, an age without passion gains in scope what is loses in intensity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
583;Christianity will not be content to be an evolution within the total category of human nature;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
584;salvation consists primarily in his beginning to sorrow earnestly over himself!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
585;On principle' one can do anything and what one does is, fundamentally, a matter of indifference, just as a man's life remains insignificant even though 'on principle' he gives his support to all the 'needs of the times.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
586;Of a man who only wills the Good out of fear of punishment, it is necessary to say with special emphasis, that he fears what a man should not and ought not to fear: loss of money, loss of reputation, misjudgment by others, neglect, the world’s judgment, the ridicule of fools, the laughter of the frivolous, the cowardly whining of consideration, the inflated triviality of the moment, the fluttering mist-forms of vapor.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
587;In a theater it happened that a fire stated offstage. The clown came out to tell the audience. They thought it was a joke and applauded. He told them again, and they became still more hilarious. This is the way, I suppose, that the world will be destroyed- amid the universal hilarity of wits and wags who think it is all a joke.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
588;Socrates proved the immortality of the soul from the fact that the sickness of the soul (sin) does not consume it as sickness of the body consumes the body. So also we can demonstrate the eternal in man from the fact that despair cannot consume his self, that this precisely is the torment of contradiction in despair. If there were nothing eternal in a man, he could not despair;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
589;All this is only fooling, for if it is true that every man must work for his own salvation, then all the prophecies about the future of the world are only valuable and allowable as a recreation, or a joke, like playing bowls or cards.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
590;If the sphere of paradox-religion is abolished, or explained away in aesthetics, an Apostle becomes neither more nor less than a genius, and then--good night, Christianity! Esprit and the Spirit, revelation and originality, a call from God and genius, all end by meaning more or less the same thing.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
591;It may happen, however, that he falls into despair just for the fact that he has opened his heart to another;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
592;In love with myself, that is what people say I am. It doesn’t surprise me, for how could they notice that I can love when I love only you;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
593;But now how can an Apostle prove that he has authority? If he could prove it physically, then he would not be an Apostle. He has no other proof than his own statement. That has to be so;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
594;In any case one can never forbear to smile at such a despairer, who, humanly speaking, although he is in despair, is so very innocent. Commonly such a despairer is infinitely comic. Think of a self (and next to God there is nothing so eternal as a self), and then that this self gets the notion of asking whether it might not let itself become or be made into another…than itself. And yet such a despairer, whose only wish is this most crazy of all transformations, loves to think that this change might be accomplished as easily as changing a coat. For the immediate man does not recognize his self, he recognizes himself only by his dress, he recognizes (and here again appears the infinitely comic trait) he recognizes that he has a self only by externals.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
595;Şcoala suferinţei e cea mai lungă, căci te pregăteşte pentru eternitate;Kierkegaard Soren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
596;Just as gold is purified in the fire, so the soul is purified in sufferings.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
597;If man were a beast or an angel, he would not be able to be in anxiety. Since he is both beast and angel, he can be in anxiety, and the greater the anxiety, the greater the man.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
598;[T]he content of the discourse should be about loving the un-lovable object… The beloved and the friend are the immediate and direct objects of immediate love, the choice of passion and of inclination. And what is the ugly? It is the neighbor, whom one shall love (373).;Kierkegaard, Søren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
599;An existing individual is constantly in process of becoming,... and translates all his thinking into terms of process. It is with (him)... as it is with a writer and his style;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
600;Love is everything. So, for one who loves, everything has ceased to have meaning in itself and only means something through the interpretation love gives it. Thus if another betrothed became convinced there was some other girl he cared for, he would presumably stand there like a criminal and his fiancée be outraged. You, however, I know would see a tribute in such a confession;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
601;Anxiety can just as well express itself by muteness as by a scream.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
602;For every single individual who escapes into the crowd... flees in cowardice from being a single individual.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
603;What good would it do me if truth stood before me, cold and naked, not caring whether I recognized her or not?;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
604;Everyone take his revenge on the world. My revenge consists in bearing my distress and anguish enclosed deeply within me while my laughter entertains everyone. If I see someone suffer I give him my sympathy, console him as best I can, and listen to him calmly when he assures me that I am fortunate. If only I can keep this up until the day I die I shall have had my revenge;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
605;our Lord satisfied the stomach before satisfying the eye, but the imagination acts in the reverse fashion;kierkegaard De Soren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
606;That in which all human life is unified is passion, and faith is a passion.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
607;When indeed does the temporal suffering oppress a man most terribly? Is it not when it seems to him that it has no significance, that it neither secures nor gains anything for him? Is it not when the suffering, as the impatient man expresses it, is without meaning or purpose?;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
608;I am poor—you are my riches;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
609;Let the thunder of a hundred cannon remind you three times daily to resist the force of habit.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
610;After all, it is the best time of one’s life, the first period of falling in love, when with every meeting, every glance, one brings home something new to rejoice over.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
611;One must see it close up, the callousness with which otherwise kind people act in the capacity of the public because their participation or non-participation seems to them a trifle - a trifle that with the contributions of the many becomes the monster.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
612;Twaddle, rubbish, and gossip is what people want, not action....The secret of life is to chatter freely about all one wishes to do and how one is always being prevented--and then do nothing.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
613;One must see how no attack is so feared as that of laughter... because more than any other this attack isolates the one attacked.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
614;The lyrical author is only concerned with his production, enjoys the pleasure of producing, often perhaps only after pain and effort;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
615;I admire you, and yet at times it seems to me as if you were deranged. Or is it not a sort of mental derangement that you subject to such a degree every passion, every emotion of the heart, every mood, to the cold discipline of reflection? Is it not mental derangement to be so normal, to be a mere idea, not a human being like the rest of us, pliant and yielding, capable of being lost and of losing ourselves? Is it not mental derangement to be always awake, always sure, never obscure and dreaming?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
616;A Reflexão é o anjo exterminador da espontaneidade… Se fosse verdade que a reflexão devesse controlar a inclinação amorosa, nunca haveria casamento.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
617;In every generation that man is a rarity who exercises such a power over himself that he can will what is not pleasant to him, that he can hold fast that truth which does not please him, hold that it is the truth although it does not please him, hold that it is the truth precisely because it does not please him, and then nevertheless, in spite of the fact that it does not please him, can commit himself to it. pp 151-2;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
618;I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding the motion is too powerful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

620;So wonderful a power is remorse, so sincere is its friendship that to escape it entirely is the most terrible thing of all.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
621;"It is comic that a mentally disordered man picks up any piece of granite and carries it around because he thinks it is money, and in the same way it is comic that Don Juan has 1,003 mistresses, for the number simply indicates that they have no value. Therefore, one should stay within one’s means in the use of the word ""love"".";Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
622;I want to run out of the world, not into a monastery—I still have my strength—but in order to find myself (that is what every fool says), in order to forget myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
623;There are two ways to be fooled: one is to believe what isn't true, the other is to refuse to believe what is true. Another translation says:There are two ways to be fooled: one is to believe what isn't so;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
624;It is terrifying when God takes out the instruments for the surgery for which no human being has the strength: to take away a person’s human zest for life, to slay him – in order that he can live as one who has died to the world and to the flesh.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
625;Truth always rests with the minority … because the minority is generally formed by those who really have an opinion, while the strength of a majority is illusory, formed by the gangs who have no opinion – Soren Kierkegaard;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

627;There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true. The other is to refuse to accept what is true.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
628;The truth is introduced – and with that it enters into the process of history. But unfortunately this does not (as so many ludicrously assume) result in the purification of the idea, which never is purer than in its primitive form. No, it results, with steadily increasing momentum, in garbling the truth, in making it dull, trite, in wearing it out, in introducing impure ingredients that originally were not present. What happens is the very opposite of filtering, until at last, by the enthusiastic cooperation and mutual consent of a number of successive generations, the point is reached where the truth is entirely extinguished and its opposite embraced;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
629;Just as the weak, despairing person is unwilling to hear anything about any consolation eternity has for him, so a person in such despair does not want to hear anything about it, either, but for a different reason: this very consolation would be his undoing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
630;Love is the unfathomable ground that is hidden in darkness, but the resolution is the triumphant victor who, like Orpheus, fetches the infatuation of falling in love to the light of day, for the resolution is the true form of love, the true explanation and transfiguration.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
631;This emphasis on the situation was particularly important in order to show that what was central for Socrates was not a fixed point but an ubique et nusquam. It was needed in order to point up the Socratic sensibility which under the subtlest and weakest contact immediately discerned the presence of the Idea, immediately felt the electricity pervading the whole existence.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
632;It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards. And if one thinks over that proposition it becomes more and more evident that life can never really be understood in time because at no particular moment can I find the necessary resting-place from which to understand it.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
633;…is a desire for what one dreads, a sympathetic antipathy. Anxiety is an alien power which lays hold of an individual, and yet one cannot tear oneself away, nor has a will to do so;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

635;sessizliklerin en kesini susmak değil, konuşmaktir.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
636;Numbers are the most dangerous of all illusions;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
637;Although in this life one may find solace in the crowd from God’s radical demands, In eternity you will look in vain for the crowd. You will listen in vain to find where the noise and the gathering is, so that you can run to it. In actual fact, For the Infinite One, there is no place, the individual is himself the place.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
638;Да, истинная любовь не пойдет большой дорогой — по ней ходит только брак;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
639;With the daguerreotype everyone will be able to have their portrait taken—formerly it was only the prominent—and at the same time everything is being done to make us all look exactly the same, so we shall only need one portrait.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
640;A thinker erects an immense building, a system, a system which embraces the whole of existence and world-history, etc. And if we contemplate his personal life, we discover to our astonishment this terrible and ludicrous fact, that he himself personally does not live in this immense high-vaulted palace, but in a barn alongside of it, or in a dog kennel, or at the most in the porter’s lodge. If one were to take the liberty of calling his attention to this by a single word, he would be offended. For he has no fear of being under a delusion, if only he can get the system completed… by means of the delusion.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
641;We make our happiness dependent on situations outside ourselves and blame others in the process if things don’t turn out well. In all our ‘freedom,’ we seek one thing: to be able to live without responsibility. Kierkegaard is convinced that Christendom is nothing but a lifeless outer shell of mediocrity. Think of a very long railway train – but long ago the locomotive ran away from it. Christendom is like this…Christendom is tranquillity – how charming, the tranquillity of not moving from the spot.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
642;If a pastor's activity in the church is merely a once-a-week attempt to tow the congregation's cargo ship a little closer to eternity, the whole thing comes to nothing. A human life, unlike a cargo ship, cannot lie in the same place until the next Sunday.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
643;The great can never do harm when grasped in their greatness.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
644;…by not venturing, it is so dreadfully easy to lose that which it would be difficult to lose in even the most venturesome venture…For if I have ventured amiss – very well, then life helps me by its punishment. But if I have not ventured at all – who then helps me?;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
645;Philosophy cannot and should not give faith, but it should understand itself and know what it has to offer and take nothing away, and least of all should fool people out of something as if it were nothing. I am not unacquainted with the perplexities and dangers of life, I do not fear them, and I encounter them buoyantly. I am not unacquainted with the dreadful, my memory is a faithful wife, and my imagination is (as I myself am not) a diligent little maiden who all day sits quietly at her work, and in the evening knows how to chat to me about it so prettily that I must look at it, though not always, I must say, is it landscapes, or flowers, or pastoral idylls she paints.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

647;Only the lower natures forget themselves and become something new. For instance, the butterfly has entirely forgotten that it was a caterpillar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
648;But just for that reason, precipitate repentance is false and is never to be sought after. For it may not be the inner anxiety of heart but only the momentary feeling that presents the guilt so actively. This kind of repentance is selfish, a matter of the senses, sensually powerful for the moment, excited in expression, impatient in the most diverse exaggerations — and, just on this account, is not real repentance. Sudden repentance would drink down all the bitterness of sorrow in a single draught and then hurry on. It wants to get away from guilt. It wants to banish all recollection of it, fortifying itself by imagining that it does this in order not to be held back in the pursuit of the Good. It is its wish that guilt, after a time, might be wholly forgotten. And once again, this is impatience. Perhaps a later sudden repentance may make it apparent that the former sudden repentance lacked true inwardness.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
649;Personally, I do not lack the courage to think a thought whole.;Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650;Not even a suicide these days does away with himself in desperation but deliberates on this step so long and so sensibly that he is strangled by calculation, making it a moot point whether or not he can really be called a suicide, inasmuch as it was in fact the deliberating that took his life. A premeditated suicide he was not, but rather a suicide by means of premeditation.;Kierkegaard, Soren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
651;. Там, где с течением времени вырабатывается индифферентность в этом отношении, поцелуй теряет свое настоящее значение. Это замечание относится преимущественно к супружеско-домашнему поцелую, которым супруги отирают после обеда друг другу рот за неимением салфетки, приговаривая: на здоровье!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

654;Learning to know anxiety is an adventure which every man has to affront if he would not go to perdition either by not having known anxiety or by sinking under it.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
655;For me, nothing is more dangerous than recollection. Once I have recalled some life-situation it ceases to exist. People say that separation helps to revive love. That is quite true, but it revives it purely in a poetic way. A life in recollection is the most perfect imaginable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
656;I do not have the courage to know anything, nor to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life isn’t like a romantic novel where opportunities are always so favourable. What I complain of is that life is not like a novel where there are hard-hearted fathers, and goblins and trolls to fight with, enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together compared to the pallid, bloodless, glutinous nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I myself give life and being.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
657;What is truth but to live for an idea?;Kierkegaard, Søren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
658;For the outward world is subjected to the law of imperfection, and again and again the experience is repeated that he too who does not work gets the bread, and that he who sleeps gets it more abundantly than the man who works. In the outward world everything is made payable to the bearer, this world is in bondage to the law of indifference, and to him who has the ring, the spirit of the ring is obedient, whether he be Noureddin or Aladdin, and he who has the world's treasure, has it, however he got it. It is different in the world of spirit. Here an eternal divine order prevails, here it does not rain both upon the just and upon the unjust, here the sun does not shine both upon the good and upon the evil, here it holds good that only he who works gets the bread, only he who was in anguish finds repose, only he who descends into the underworld rescues the beloved, only he who draws the knife gets Isaac.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

662;What is to come? What does the future hold? I don’t know, I have no idea. When from a fixed point a spider plunges down as is its nature, it sees always before it an empty space in which it cannot find a footing however much it flounders. That is how it is with me: always an empty space before me, what drives me on is a result that lies behind me. This life is back-to-front and terrible, unendurable.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
663;For leveling really to come about a phantom must first be provided, its spirit, a monstrous abstraction, an all-encompassing something that is nothing, a mirage -- this phantom is the public. Only a passionless but reflective age can spin this phantom out, with the help of the press when the press itself becomes an abstraction ... [and] the only thing that can keep life going in the prevailing torpor.;Kierkegaard, Soren;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
664;My reflection on life altogether lacks meaning. I take it some evil spirit has put a pair of spectacles on my nose, one glass of which magnifies to an enormous degree, while the other reduces to the same degree.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

668;Din ce motiv o fată are temeri în prezenţa bărbatului?Din motivul care se numeşte intelect.Pentru că intelectul este negaţia însăşi a întregii existenţe feminine.Frumuseţea masculină,natura suprinzătoare a bărbatului etc,sunt mijloace bune pentru a face cuceriri,dar numai cu ele nu vei avea niciodată victoria totală.De ce?Pentru că te războieşti cu plinătatea forţelor unei fete tinere şi în acest domeniu ea este întodeauna cea mai tare.Acele mijloace pot s-o facă să roşească pe o fată,s-o facă să-şi plece ochii,dar niciodată să-i provoace acea angoasă indescriptibilă şi insidioasă care îi face frumuseţea atât de interesantă.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

680;True, fear deceptively offers to help us. It too offers to keep us on the right track. Yet the one who strives in fear never becomes God’s friend. Fear is a deceitful aid. It can sour your delight, make life arduous and miserable, make you old and decrepit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
681;There are two ways to be fooled. One is too believe what isn’t true;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
682;For faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
683;But what every man has not a right to do, is to make others believe that faith is something lowly, or that it is an easy thing,whereas it is the greatest and the hardest.;Soren Kierkeggard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
684;For clarity's sake, and before going further with this account, I shall identify true aesthetic sorrow a little more closely. Sorrow has the opposite movement to that of pain. So long as one doesn't spoil things out of a misplaced mania for consistency―something I shall prevent also in another way―one may say: the more innocence, the deeper the sorrow. If you press this too far, you destroy the tragic. There is always an element of guilt left over, but it is never properly reflected in the subject;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
685;Doubt is conquered by faith, just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
686;Most men pursue pleasure with such breathless haste that they hurry past it. They fare as did that dwarf who kept guard over a captured princess in his castle. One day he took midday nap. When he woke up an hour later, the princess was gone. Quickly he pulled on his seven-league boots;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

689;,,,all clannishness is divisive...For all clannishness is the enemy of universal humanity. But to will only one thing, genuinely to will the Good, as an individual, to will to hold fast to God, which things each person without exception is capable of doing, this is what unites.;Soren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
690;The spirit of dialectical fearlessness is not so easily acquired;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
691;However, a self, every instant it exists, is in process of becoming, for the self [potentially] does not actually exist, it is only that which it is to become. In so far as the self does not become itself, it is not its own self;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
692;Passion excites, earthly wisdom cools, but neither this heat nor this coolness, nor the blending of the heat and coolness is the pure air of the eternal. There is in this heat something ardent, and in this coolness something sharp, and in the blending of the two something indefinite, or an unconscious deceitfulness, as in the hazardous season of spring. But this 'thou shalt love' takes away all the unsoundness and preserves the soundness of eternity.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
693;If a man in truth wills the Good then he must be willing to suffer all for the Good.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
694;There is something spectral about me - and this is both the good and the bad in me - something that makes it impossible for anyone to endure having to see me every day and thus have a real relationship with me. Of course, in the light cloak in which I generally show myself, it is another matter. But at home it would be noted that I fundamentally dwell in a spirit world. I had been engaged to her for 1 year, and she did not really know me. - So she would have been shattered. In turn, she would probably have made a mess of me, for I was constantly overstraining myself with her because in a certain sense reality was too light. I was too heavy for her, and she was too light for me, but both can truly lead to overstraining myself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

698;Con toda seguridad, quien induce al error a los demás, debe caer también en este mismo error. Cuando algún viajero extraviado pregunta por el camino a seguir, es muy reprobable indicarle un rumbo falso y luego dejarle marchar solo, pero carece de importancia si se compara con el daño que se hace a quien se impulsa a perder por las rutas de su alma. Al viajero extraviado le queda, por lo menos, el consuelo del paisaje, que le rodea, casi siempre variado, y la esperanza de que a cada recodo encuentre el buen camino;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

701;every actual instant of despair is to be referred back to possibility, every instant the man in despair is contracting it, it is constantly in the present tense, nothing comes to pass here as a consequence of a bygone actuality superseded. at every actual instant of despair the despairer bears as his responsibility all the foregoing experience in possibility as a present.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
702;When the past is allowed to remain what it is, the past, when a person leaves it by stepping onto the good path and does not look back too often, he himself is changed little by little, and the past is imperceptibly changed at the same time, and eventually they do not, so to speak, suit each other. The past fades away into a less definite form, becomes a recollection, and the recollection becomes less and less terrifying. It becomes quieter, it becomes gentle, it becomes sad, and in each of these attributes it is becoming more and more distanced . Finally the past becomes almost alien to him;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
703;But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow. But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall. This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
704;اما چگونه میتوان از اقربا نفرت داشت؟!وظیفه مطلق می تواند به انجام عملی منجر شود که اخلاق آن را منع کرده است;" اما به هیچ وجه نمی تواند شهسوار ایمان را از دوست داشتن بازدارد. این آن چیزی است که ابراهیم نشان می دهد. لحظه ای که میخواهد اسحاق را قربانی کند به لسان اخلاق از او متنفر است. اما اگر به راستی از او متنفر باشد می تواند مطمئن باشد که خدا این قربانی را از او نخواسته است؛ در حقیقت قابیل و ابراهیم یکسان نیستند.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

708;The sorcerer Virgil had himself chopped in pieces and placed in a cauldron to be cooked for eight days, thus to become rejuvenated.10 He had someone watch out that no intruder peeped into the cauldron. The watchman was unable, however, to resist the temptation. It was too soon. Virgil disappeared with a cry, like a little child. I, too, have probably looked too early into the cauldron, into the cauldron of life and its historical development, and no doubt will never manage to be more than a child.

731;The indolent old man hopes that his death is still a long way off. But repentance and remorse belong to the eternal in a man. And in this way each time that repentance comprehends guilt it understands that the eleventh hour has come: that hour which human indolence knows well enough exists and will come, when it is talked about in generalities, but not when it actually applies to the indolent one himself. For even the old man thinks that there is some time left and the indolent youth deceives himself when he thinks that difference in age is the determining factor in regard to the nearness of the eleventh hour.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

735;A man ten times regrets havingspoken, for the once he regrets his silence. And why? Because the factof having spoken is an external fact, which may involve one inannoyances, since it is an actuality. But the fact of having kept silent!Yet this is the most dangerous thing of all. For by keeping silent one isrelegated solely to oneself, no actuality comes to a man’s aid bypunishing him, by bringing down upon him the consequences of hisspeech. No, in this respect, to be silent is the easy way. But he whoknows what the dreadful is, must for this very reason be most fearfulof every fault, of every sin, which takes an inward direction and leavesno outward trace.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And that is how it is with us human beings. All of earthly existence is a sort of infirmity.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Αλλά σύμφυτη με κάθε πάθος που φτάνει στο αποκορύφωμα του, είναι πάντα η θέληση της αυτοκαταστροφής του: έτσι και το ύψιστο πάθος της λογικής είναι να θέλει ένα εμπόδιο, το οποία με τον έναν ή τον άλλο τρόπο, να προκαλεί την απώλεια της. Το ύψιστο παράδοξο της σκέψης είναι, κατ’ αντιστοιχία, η θέληση ν’ ανακαλύψει κάτι που ξεφεύγει απ’ την επιρροή της.;Soren Kierkeggard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The explanation is therefore subsequent. The prohibition induces in him anxiety, for the prohibition awakens in him freedom's possibility.

791;Whatever one generation learns from another, it can never learn from a predecessor the genuinely human factor. In this respect every generation begins afresh, has no task other than that of any previous generation, and comes no further, provided the latter didn't shirk its task and deceive itself. This authentically human factor is passion, in which the one generation also fully understands the other and understands itself. Thus no generation has learned from another how to love, no generation can begin other than at the beginning, the task of no later generation is shorter than its predecessor's, and if someone, unlike the previous generation, is unwilling to stay with love but wants to go further, then that is simply idle and foolish talk.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

800;There is so much talk about being offended by christianity because it is so dark and gloomy, offended because it is so rigorous etc. But it would be best of all to explain for once that the real reason that men are offended by christianity is that it is too high, because its goal is not man's goal, because it wants to make man into something so extraordinary that he cannot grasp the thought.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

812;So long as the generation only worries about its task, which is the highest it can attain to, it cannot grow weary. That task is always enough for a human lifetime. When children on holiday get through all their games by noon and then ask impatiently, 'Can't anyone think of a new game?', does this show that they are more developed and advanced than children of the same or a previous generation who could make the games they already know last the whole day? Or does it not rather show that those children lack what I would call the good-natured seriousness that belongs to play?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

How would I ever get on in this world? Herein lies the real place of Christian scholarship. Christian scholarship is the Church’s prodigious invention to defend itself against the Bible, to ensure that we can continue to be good Christians without the Bible coming too close. Oh, priceless scholarship, what would we do without you? Dreadful it is to fall into the hands of the living God. Yes, it is even dreadful to be alone with the New Testament.I open the New Testament and read: ‘If you want to be perfect, then sell all your goods and give to the poor and come follow me.’ Good God, if we were to actually do this all the capitalists, the officeholders, and the entrepreneurs, the whole society in fact, would be almost beggars! We would be sunk if it were not for Christian scholarship!

With a premature anxiety I have tried to avoid coming in close contact with those things whose force of attraction might be too powerful for me. I have sought to appropriate much from them, studied their distinctive characteristics and meaning in human life, but at the same time guarded against coming, like the moth, too close to the flame. I have had little to win or to lose in association with the ordinary run of men, partly because what they do―so-called practical life―does not interest me much, partly because their coldness and indifference to the spiritual and deeper currents in man alienate me even more from them.

869;A man can wish to slink away from many things in life, and he may even succeed, so that life’s favored one can say in the last moment, I slipped away from all the cares under which other men suffered. But if such a person wishes to bluster out of, to defy, or to slink away from remorse, alas, which is indeed the most terrible to say of him, that he failed, or — that he succeeded?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

873;"How far removed in time must an event be for us to remember it? How far for memory's longing to be no longer able to seize it? Most people have a limit in this respect: what lies too near them in time they cannot remember, nor what lies too remote. I know no limit. What was experienced yesterday, I push back a thousand years in time, and remember as if it were yesterday.""―Johannes de Silentio, from_Either/Or_";Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
874;he who loves God without faith reflects upon himself he who loves God believingly reflects upon God.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
875;And the desire to prevent all misunderstanding about an enterprise one is about to undertake is a thing that could occur only to a youth. There is nothing that so easily gets beyond one's control and so easily becomes misunderstood, as a misunderstanding. Even if one were to undertake nothing more than merely to avoid misunderstanding – then in that case one would presumably become the most thoroughly misunderstood of all men.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
876;The glorious memory to be preserved by the human race, the promise in Abraham’s seed – this was only a whim, a fleeting thought which the Lord had had, which Abraham should now obliterate. That glorious treasure which was just as old as faith in Abraham’s heart, many, many years older than Isaac, the fruit of Abraham’s life, sanctified by prayers, matured in conflict – the blessing upon Abraham’s lips, this fruit was now to be plucked prematurely and remain without significance.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

881;What is the Absurd? It is, as may quite easily be seen, that I, a rational being, must act in a case where my reason, my powers of reflection, tell me: you can just as well do the one thing as the other, that is to say where my reason and reflection say: you cannot act and yet here is where I have to act... The Absurd, or to act by virtue of the absurd, is to act upon faith ... I must act, but reflection has closed the road so I take one of the possibilities and say: This is what I do, I cannot do otherwise because I am brought to a standstill by my powers of reflection.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
882;Abraham was greater than all, great by reason of his power whose strength is impotence, great by reason of his wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by reason of his hope whose form is madness, great by reason of the love which is hatred of oneself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

885;But you may be sure that for this faith in the victory of the beautiful I will engage in mortal combat, and nothing in the world can wrest it from me. Even if one wished to wrest if from me through prayer, to snatch it from me by force, not for anything in the world would I let myself be deprived f it, for if I lost that faith I would lose the whole world. Through this faith I see the beauty of life, and the beauty I see does not have the sadness and melancholy that are inseparable from all beauty in nature and art, inseparable even from the eternal youth of the Greek gods. The beauty I see is joyful and triumphant, and stronger than all the world. And this beauty I see everywhere, even where your eye sees nothing.;Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or, Part I;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

892;The call to find the way again by seeking out God in the confession of sins is always at the eleventh hour. Whether you are young or old, whether you have sinned much or little, whether you have offended much or neglected much, the guilt makes this call come at the eleventh hour. The inner agitation of the heart understands what remorse insists upon, that the eleventh hour has come. For in the sense of time, the old man’s age is the eleventh hour;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

896;"Something wonderful has happened to me. I was carried up into the seventh heaven. There all the gods sat assembled. By special grace I was granted the favor of a wish. ""Will you,"" said Mercury, ""have youth, or beauty, or power, or a long life, or the most beautiful maiden, or any of the other glories we have in the chest? Choose, but only one thing."" For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed myself to the gods as follows: ""Most honorable contemporaries, I choose this one thing, that I may always have the laugh on my side."" Not one of the gods said a word, on the contrary, they all began to laugh. Hence, I concluded that my request was granted, and found that the gods knew how to express themselves with taste";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

You come into collision with it, and because of this you will gradually be brought into such tension that you will then be able to become certain of what Christ taught. You will begin to understand that you cannot endure this world without having recourse to Christ. What else can one expect from following the truth?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
909;Anxiety is a response to the awareness of one’s freedom, of one’s power to gaze into the yawning abyss of possibilities, and through an act of choice actualize one of those potentialities. It is a response to the recognition that one is free to choose from possibilities, and therefore ultimately responsible for oneself and one’s future. This awesome sense of freedom and responsibility is apprehended as simultaneously attractive and repulsive, an ambivalence Kierkegaard called dread.;Søren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
910;Cuando una muchacha no despierta en nosotros desde la primera mirada una impresión tan viva que cree una imagen ideal de sí misma, generalmente no es digna de que nos tomemos el trabajo de buscarla en la realidad.

916;É proprio caratteristico di quelle che si chiamano individualità infelici di aggrapparsi tenacissimamente a se stesse, tanto che nonostante tutte le loro sofferenze, per nessuna ragione al mondo vorrebbero essere degli altri. Ciò ha il suo motivo nel fatto che queste individualità sono molto vicine alla verità e sentono I’eterno valore della personalità, non nella sua benedizione, ma nel suo tormento. Anche se devono rinunciare alla gioia, preferiscono tuttavia rimanere se stessi.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

920;Pese a todo, el Dios del Amor es ciego y cuando se pone esmero, no es difícil engañarlo. El verdadero arte reside en adquirir la perceptibilidad emotiva mayor que se pueda, saber qué impresión se causa y cuál es la que se percibe de una muchacha. De este modo, se puede estar enamorado de muchas mujeres a la vez, puesto que se ama en grado distinto las distintas cualidades que cada una posee. Es muy poco amar a una sola, amarlas a todas se considera superficial, pero conocerse uno mismo y amar a todas las que se pueda, de tal manera que el alma se alimente, mientras la conciencia lo abarca todo, ¡ese es el placer, esa es la vida!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is a girl, more beautiful than my soul’s dream, purer than the light of the sun, deeper than the source of the ocean, more proud than the flight of the eagle―there is a girl―oh! bend your head to my ear and my words, that my secret may steal into it―this girl I love more dearly than my life, for she is my life;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

947;So there I sat and smoked my cigar until I drifted into thought. Among other thoughts, I recall these. You are getting on in years, I said to myself, and are becoming an old man without being anything and without actually undertaking anything. On the other hand, wherever you look in literature or in life, you see the names and figures of celebrities, the prized and highly acclaimed people, prominent or much discussed, the many benefactors of the age who know how to benefit humankind by making life easier and easier, some by railroads, others by omnibuses and steamships, others by telegraph, others by easily understood surveys and brief publications about everything worth knowing, and finally the true benefactors of the age who by virtue of thought systematically make spiritual existence easier and easier and yet more and more meaningful—and what are you doing?…So only one lack remains [in our time], even though not yet felt, the lack of difficulty. Out of love of humankind, out of despair over my awkward predicament of having achieved nothing and of being unable to make anything easier than it had already been made, out of genuine interest in those who make everything easy, I comprehended that it was my task: to make difficulties everywhere.-Søren Kierkegaard;Soren Kierkegaard;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

954;For there is indeed danger. There is a danger that is called delusion. It is unable to check itself. It goes on and on: then it is called perdition. But there is a concerned guide, a knowing one, who attracts the attention of the wanderer, who calls out to him that he should take care. That guide is remorse. He is not so quick of foot as the indulgent imagination, which is the servant of desire. He is not so strongly built as the victorious intention. He comes on slowly afterwards. He grieves. But he is a sincere and faithful friend. If that guide’s voice is never heard, then it is just because one is wandering along the way of perdition.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
955;So wonderful a power is remorse, so sincere is its friendship that to escape it entirely is the most terrible thing of all. A man can wish to slink away from many things in life, and he may even succeed, so that life’s favored one can say in the last moment, I slipped away from all the cares under which other men suffered. But if such a person wishes to bluster out of, to defy, or to slink away from remorse, alas, which is indeed the most terrible to say of him, that he failed, or—that he succeeded? A Providence watches over each man’s wandering through life. It provides him with two guides. The one calls him forward. The other calls him back.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

958;The two guides call out to a man early and late, and when he listens to their call, then he finds his way, then he can know where he is, on the way. Because these two calls designate the place and show the way. Of these two, the call of remorse is perhaps the best. For the eager traveler who travels lightly along the way does not, in this fashion, learn to know it as well as a wayfarer with a heavy burden. The one who merely strives to get on does not learn to know the way as well as the remorseful man. The eager traveler hurries forward to the new, to the novel, and, indeed, away from experience. But the remorseful one, who comes behind, laboriously gathers up experience.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

961;For if one makes faith everything, that is, makes it what it is, then, according to my way of thinking, one may speak of it without danger in our age, which hardly extravagates in the matter of faith, and it is only by faith one attains likeness to Abraham, not by murder. If one makes love a transitory mood, a voluptuous emotion in a man, then one only lays pitfalls for the weak when one would talk about the exploits of love.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

969;It is supposed to be difficult to understand Hegel, but to understand Abraham is a trifle. To go beyond Hegel is a miracle, but to get beyond Abraham is the easiest thing of all. I for my part have devoted a good deal of time to the understanding of the Hegelian philosophy, I believe also that I understand it tolerably well, but when in spite of the trouble I have taken there are certain passages I cannot understand, I am foolhardy enough to think that he himself has not been quite clear. All this I do easily and naturally, my head does not suffer from it. But on the other hand when I have to think of Abraham, I am as though annihilated. I catch sight every moment of that enormous paradox which is the substance of Abraham's life, every moment I am repelled, and my thought in spite of all its passion cannot get a hairs-breadth further. I strain every muscle to get a view of it–that very instant I am paralyzed.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

978;Repentance is the highest ethical contradiction, partly because by demanding ideality it has to content itself with accepting repentance, partly because repentance is dialectically ambiguous regarding what it is to cancel, an ambiguity that dogmatics cancels only in the Atonement, in which the category of hereditary sin becomes clear. Moreover repentance delays action, and action is precisely what ethics demands. Finally, repentance must become an object to itself, seeing that the moment of repentance becomes a deficit of action.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

""Will you,"" said Mercury, ""have youth, or beauty, or power, or a long life, or the most beautiful maiden, or any of the other glories we have in the chest? Choose, but only one thing."" For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed myself to the gods as follows: ""Most honorable contemporaries, I choose this one thing, that I may always have the laugh on my side."" Not one of the gods said a word, on the contrary, they all began to laugh.

But no one ever got possibility out of it, possibility, this marvelous thing that is so infinitely fragile (the most delicate shoot of spring is not so fragile!), so infinitely frail (the finest woven linen is not so frail!), and yet, brought into being and shaped with the help of the eternal, stronger than anything else, if it is the possibility of the good!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1011;"Dear Reader: I wonder if you may not sometimes have felt inclined to doubt a little the correctness of the familiar philosophic maxim that the external is the internal and the internal the external. â€¦ For my part I have always been heretically-minded on this point in philosophy, and have therefore early accustomed myself, as far as possible, to institute observations and inquiries concerning it. I have sought guidance from those authors whose views I shared on this matter; in short, I have done everything in my power to remedy the deficiency in the philosophical works. Gradually the sense of hearing came to be my favorite sense; for just as the voice is the revelation of the inwardness incommensurable with the outer, so the ear is the instrument by which this inwardness is apprehended, hearing found a contradiction between what I saw and what I heard, then I found my doubt confirmed, and my enthusiasm for the investigation stimulated.â€";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1012;These papers have afforded me an insight into the lives of two men, which has confirmed my hunch that the external is not the internal. This was especially true about one of them. His external mode of life has been in complete contradiction to his inner life. The same was true to a certain extent with the other also, inasmuch as he concealed a more significant inwardness under a somewhat commonplace exterior.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1013;Aâ€™s papers contain a number of attempts to formulate an aesthetic philosophy of life. A single, coherent, aesthetic view of life can scarcely be carried out. Bâ€™s papers contain an ethical view of life. As I let this thought sink into my soul, it became clear to me that I might make use of it in choosing a title. The one I have selected precisely expresses this. The reader cannot lose very much because of this title, for while reading the book he may perfectly well forget the title. Then, when he has read the book, he may perhaps reflect upon the title. This will free him from all finite questions as to whether A was really convinced of his error and repented, whether B conquered, or if it perhaps ended by B going over to Aâ€™s opinion. In this respect these papers have no ending.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This procedure may seem more than peculiar. The proof that Don Juan is a classic work is in the strictest sense a problem for thought; while, on the contrary, the other attempt, with regard to the exact sphere of thought, is quite irrelevant. The movement of thought is satisfied with having it recognized that Don Juan is a classic, and that every classic production is equally perfect; to desire to do more than that is for thought a thing of evil.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1044;Should anyone be called upon to say that the tragic always remains the tragic, I should in a sense have no objection to make, in so far as every historical evolution always remains in the sphere of the concept.

Whoever has at any time made his own laughter and that of others the subject of his observation; whoever, in this study, has had his eye no so much on the accidental as on the general; whoever has observed with psychological interest how different are the things which in each generation arouse laughter, will readily be convinced that the invariable requirement that comedy ought to arouse laughter contains a high degree of variability relative to the different conceptions of the ridiculous entertained in the world consciousness, without the variability becoming so diffuse that the corresponding somatic expression would be that laughter expressed itself in tears. So also in relation to the tragic.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1046;"It is of the essence of joy to reveal itself, while grief tries to hide, sometimes even to deceive. Joy is communicative, social, open-hearted, and desires expression; grief is secretive, silent, solitary, and seeks to retire into itself. The truth of this remark will surely not be denied by anyone who has even a moderate acquaintance with life. There are men so constituted that under the stress of emotion, the blood rushes to the surface, making the inner emotion outwardly visible; others are so constituted that the blood flows backward, seeking the inner parts of the chambers of the heart. A somewhat similar relation exists as to the mode of expression, between joy and grief.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hence, unless the artist is satisfied with the naÃ¯vetÃ© sometimes found in old books, where a figure is drawn that could represent almost anything, which bears on its breast a plate in the form of a heart or the like, to which it points or otherwise calls attention, whereupon one may read a description of the picture, an effect the artist could just as well have produced by writing above the picture: Please note-he will have to renounce the idea of portraying reflective grief, leaving it to be dealt with by poets or psychologists. It is this reflective grief which I now propose to bring before you and, as far as possible, render visible by means of some pictures. I call these sketches Shadowgraphs, partly by the designation to remind you at once that they derive from the darker side of life, partly because like other shadowgraphs they are not directly visible.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When, then, consciousness has so come to itself that it possesses the entire content, then the moment has arrived which contains the possibility of real creation; and yet something is missing; missing is the occasion, which one might say is equally necessary, although in another sense, it is infinitely insignificant. Thus it has pleased the gods to join the greatest contradictions together. This is a mystery in which reality abounds, a stumbling block to the Jews, and to the Greeks foolishness. The occasion is always the accidental, and thus is the tremendous paradox, that the accidental is just as absolutely necessary as the necessary. The occasion is not in the ideal sense the accidental, as when I logically think the accidental; but the occasion is, irrationally regarded, the accidental, and yet in this accidentality, the necessary.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1050;"Since boredom advances and boredom is the root of all evil, no wonder, then, that the world goes backwards, that evil spreads. This can be traced back to the very beginning of the world. The gods were bored; therefore they created human beings. Adam was bored because he was alone; therefore Eve was created. Since that moment, boredom entered the world and grew in quantity in exact proportion to the growth of population. Adam was bored alone; then Adam and Eve were bored en famille. After that, the population of the world increased and the nations were bored en masse. To amuse themselves, they hit upon the notion of building a tower so high that it would reach the sky. This notion is just as boring as the tower was high and is a terrible demonstration of how boredom had gained the upper hand. Then they were dispersed around the world, just as people now travel abroad, but they continued to be bored. And what consequences this boredom had: humankind stood tall and fell far, first through Eve, then from the Babylonian tower.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The law under which one slaves is equally boring no matter whether advancement is swift or slow.

1056;How often do we have an urge to go beyond the historical consciousness, a longing, a homesickness for the primeval forest that lies behind us, and does not this longing acquire a double significance when it joins to itself the conception of another being whose home is also in that region? Therefore, every marriage, even one that is entered into after sober consideration, has an urge, at least in particular moments, to imagine such a foreground. And how beautiful it is that the God who is spirit also loves the earthly love. That there is much lying among married people on this score, I readily admit to you, and that your observations along this line have frequently amused me, but the truth in it ought not to be forgotten. Perhaps someone thinks it is better to have complete authority in the choice of â€œoneâ€™s life-partner,â€ but such an expression as that betrays an extreme narrowness of mind and foolish self-importance of understanding and has no intimation that in its genius romantic love is free and that precisely this genius constitutes its greatness.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1057;"It is beautiful and healthy if a person has been unfortunate in his first love, has learned to know the pain of it but nevertheless remains faithful to his love, has kept his faith in this first love; it is beautiful if in the course of the years he at times very vividly recalls it, and even though his soul has been sufficiently healthy to bid farewell, as it were, to that kind of life in order to dedicate himself to something higher; it is beautiful if he then sadly remember it as something that was admittedly not perfect but yet was so very beautiful. And then sadness is far more beautiful and healthy and noble than the prosaic common sense that has long since finished with all such childishness, this devilish prudence of choir director Basil that fancies itself to be healthy but which is the most penetratingly wasting illness; for what does it profit a man if he gained the whole world but lost his soul? For me the phrase â€œthe first loveâ€ has no sadness at all, or at least only a little admixture of sweet sadness; for me it is a password, and although I have been a married man for several years, I have the honor fight to under the victorious banner of the first love.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And it orders me to be faithful to her-do I need to be ordered, I who belong to her with my whole soul! And this authority determines our relation to each other; it says that I am to order and she to obey; but what if I do not want to order, what if I feel too inferior for that? No, her I will obey; for me her hint is my command but I will not submit to an alien authority.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Allow me to point out the dark side of your life â€¦ think of the pain, sadness, and humiliation involved in being in this sense a stranger and an alien in the world. ... think of family life in its beauty, founded on a deep and intimate community in such a way that what joins it all together is still mysteriously hidden, the one relationship ingeniously entwined with the other so that one has only an intimation of the coherence; think of this familyâ€™s concealed internal life, clad in such beautiful external form that one nowhere encounters the hardness of the joints-and now contemplate your relationship to such a family.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1061;"In my insisting that adversity is part of marriage, I by no means permit you to identify marriage with a retinue of adversities. It is already implicit in the resignation contained in the resolution that there will be accompanying adversities, except that these have not as yet assumed a definite shape and are not alarming, since on the contrary they are already seen as overcome in the resolution. Furthermore, adversity is not seen externally but internally in its reflection in the individual, but this belongs to the shared history of marital love. Secretiveness becomes a contradiction when it has nothing to keep secret, a childishness when it is only amorous bric-a-brac that constitutes its deposit. Not until the individualâ€™s love has truly opened his heart, made him eloquent in a much profounder sense than that in which one usually says that love makes one eloquent (for even the seducer may have that kind of eloquence), not until the individual has deposited everything in the shared consciousness, not until then does secretiveness gain its strength, life and meaning. But a decisive step is required for this, and consequently courage is also required; yet marital love collapses into nothing if this does not take place, for only thereby does one show that one loves not oneself but another.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1062;And in truth, he who has humility and courage enough to let himself be esthetically transformed, he who feels himself present as a character in a drama the deity is writing, in which the poet and prompter are not different persons, in which the individual, as the experienced actor who has lived into his character and his lines is not disturbed by the prompter but feels that he himself becomes a question whether he is putting the words in the prompterâ€™s mouth or the prompter in his, he who in the most profound sense feels himself creating and created, who in the moment he feels himself creating has the original pathos of the lines and the moment he feels himself created has the erotic ear that picks up every sound-he and he alone has brought into actual existence the highest in esthetics. But this history that proves to be incommensurable even for poetry is the inner history. This has the idea within itself and precisely therefore is the esthetic. Therefore it begins, as I expressed it with the possession, and its progress is the acquiring of this possession. It is an eternity in which the temporal has not disappeared as an ideal element, but in which it is continually present as a real element. Thus, when patience acquires itself in patience, it is inner history.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1063;â€¦ what does it mean to commit oneself to love? Where is the boundary? When have I fulfilled my duty? In what, more closely defined, does my duty consist? In case of doubt, to what council can I apply? And if I cannot fulfill my duty, where is the authority to compel me? State and Church have indeed set a certain limit, but even though I do not go to the extreme, can I not therefore be a bad husband? Who will punish me? Who will stand up for her who is the victim? Answer: you yourself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1064;"This is what is sad when one contemplates human life, that so many live out their lives in quiet lostness; they outlive themselves, not in the sense that life's content successively unfolds and is now possessed in the unfolding, but they live, as it were, away from themselves and vanish like shadows. Their immortal souls are blown away, and they are not disquieted by the question of its immortality, because they are already disintegrated before they die.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1067;"What, then, is depression? It is hysteria of the spirit. There comes a moment in a personâ€™s life when immediacy is ripe, so to speak, and when the spirit requires a higher form, when it wants to lay hold of itself as spirit. As immediate spirit, a person is bound up with all the earthly life, and now spirit wants to gather itself together out of this dispersion, so to speak, and to transfigure itself in itself; the personality wants to become conscious in its eternal validity. If this does not happen, if the movement is halted, if it is repressed, then depression sets in.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1068;"What intoxication is as beautiful as despair â€¦ It gives a slight flourish to the hat and to the whole body; it gives a proud, defiant look. The lips smile haughtily. It provides an indescribable lightness to life, a regal outlook on everything.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1070;"Do not interrupt the flight of your soul; do not distress what is best in you; do not enfeeble your spirit with half wishes and half thoughts. Ask yourself and keep on asking until you find the answer, for one may have known something many times, acknowledged it; one may have willed something many times, attempted it â€” and yet, only the deep inner motion, only the heart's indescribable emotion, only that will convince you that what you have acknowledged belongs to you, that no power can take it from you â€” for only the truth that builds up is truth for you.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1071;Father in heaven! Teach us to pray rightly so that our hearts may open up to you in prayer and supplication and hide no furtive desire that we know is not acceptable to you, nor any secret fear that you will deny us anything that will truly be for our good, so that the labouring thoughts, the restless mind, the fearful heart may find rest in and through that alone in which and through which it can be found-by always joyfully thanking you as we gladly confess that in relation to you we are always in the wrong.

1073;"If a person is sometimes in the right, sometimes in the wrong, to some degree in the right, to some degree in the wrong, who, then, is the one who makes that decision except the person himself, but in the decision may he not again be to some degree to the right and to some degree in the wrong? Or is he a different person when he judges his act then when he acts? Is doubt to rule, then, continually to discover new difficulties, and is care to accompany the anguished soul and drum past experiences into it? Or would we prefer continually to be in the right in the way irrational creatures are? Then we have only the choice between being nothing in relation to God or having to begin all over again every moment in eternal torment, yet without being able to begin, for if we are able to decide definitely with regard to the previous moment, and so further and further back. Doubt is again set in motion, care again aroused; let us try to calm it by deliberating on: The Upbuilding That Lies In The Thought That In Relation To God We Are Always In The Wrong";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1074;"As the Pastor puts it, ""Therefore, wishing to be in the wrong is an expression of an infinite relationship, and wanting to be in the right, or finding it painful to be in the wrong, is an expression of a finite relationship!

1075;Not merely in the realm of commerce but in the world of ideas as well our age is organizing a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1076;"The present writer is nothing of a philosopher, he has not understood the System, does not know whether it actually exists, whether it is completed ; already he has enough for his weak head in the thought of what a prodigious head everybody in our day must have, since everybody has such a prodigious thought. Even though one were capable of converting the whole content of faith into the form of a concept, it does not follow that one has adequately conceived faith and understands how one got into it, or how it got into one. The present writer is nothing of a philosopher ; he is, poetice et eleganter, an amateur writer who neither writes the System nor promises of the System, who neither subscribes to the System nor ascribes anything to it. He writes because for him it is a luxury which becomes the more agreeable and more evident, the fewer there are who buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an age when passion has been obliterated in favor of learning, in an age when an author who wants to have readers must take care to write in such a way that the book can easily be perused during the afternoon nap, and take care to fashion his outward deportment in likeness to the picture of that polite young gardener in the advertisement sheet, who with hat in hand, and with a good certificate from the place where he last served, recommends himself to the esteemed public. He foresees his fate â€“ that he will be entirely ignored. He has a presentiment of the dreadful event, that a jealous criticism will many a time let him feel the birch ; he trembles at the still more dreadful thought that one or another enterprising scribe, a gulper of paragraphs, who to rescue learning is always willing to do with other peoplesâ€™ writings what Trop magnanimously resolved to do with a book called The Destruction of the Human Race â€“ that is, he will slice the author into paragraphs, and will do it with the same inflexibility as the man who in the interest of the science of punctuation divided his discourse by counting the words, so that there were fifty words for a period and thirty-five for a semicolon.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1080;When the child must be weaned, the mother blackens her breast, it would indeed be a shame that the breast should look delicious when the child must not have it. So the child believes that the breast has changed, but the mother is the same, her glance is as loving and tender as ever. Happy the person who had no need of more dreadful expedients for weaning the child !;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1081;When the child has grown big and must be weaned, the mother virginally hides her breast, so the child has no more a mother. Happy the child which did not in another way lose its mother.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1082;"It was a quiet evening when Abraham rode out alone, and he rode to Mount Moriah ; he threw himself upon his face, he prayed God to forgive him his sin, that he had been willing to offer Isaac, that the father had forgotten his duty toward the son. Often he rode his lonely way, but he found no rest. He could not comprehend that it was a sin to be willing to offer to God the best thing he possessed, that for which he would many times have given his life ; and if it was a sin, if he had not loved Isaac as he did, then he could not understand that it might be forgiven. For what sin could be more dreadful?";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1083;When the child must be weaned, the mother too is not without sorrow at the thought that she and the child are separated more and more, that the child which first lay under her heart and later reposed upon her breast will be so near to her no more. So they mourn together for the brief period of mourning. Happy the person who has kept the child as near and needed not to sorrow any more!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1085;If a human being did not have an eternal consciousness, if underlying everything there were only a wild, fermenting power that writhing in dark passions produced everything, be it significant or insignificant, if a vast, never appeased emptiness is beneath everything, what would life be then but despair?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1087;For he who loved himself became great by himself, and he who loved other men became great by his selfless devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1088;but Abraham was greater than all, great by reason of his power whose strength is impotence, great by reason of his wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by reason of his hope whose form is madness, great by reason of the love which is hatred of oneself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1089;From the external and visible world comes the old adage: â€œOnly one who works gets bread.â€ Oddly enough, the adage does not fit the world in which it is most at home, for imperfection is the fundamental law of the external world, and here it happens again and again that he who does not work does get bread, and he who sleeps gets more abundantly than he who works. In the external world, everything belongs to the possessor.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1090;for he who loves God without faith reflects upon himself, he who loves God believingly reflects upon God.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1091;For the outward world is subjected to the law of imperfection, and again and again the experience is repeated that he too who does not work gets the bread, and that he who sleeps gets it more abundantly than the man who works. In the outward world everything is made payable to the bearer, this world is in bondage to the law of indifference, and to him who has the ring, the spirit of the ring is obedient, whether he be Noureddin or Aladdin, and he who has the world's treasure, has it, however he got it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1092;How is one to explain the contradiction illustrated by that orator? Is it because Abraham had a prescriptive right to be a great man, so that what he did is great, and when another does the same it is sin, a heinous sin? In that case I do not wish to participate in such thoughtless eulogy. If faith does not make it a holy act to be willing to murder one's son then let the same condemnation be pronounced upon Abraham as upon every other man.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1093;For when faith is eliminated by becoming null or nothing, then there only remains the crude fact that Abraham wanted to murder Isaac - which is easy enough for anyone to imitate who has not faith, the faith, that is to say, which makes it hard for him.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1094;Can one then speak plainly about Abraham without incurring the danger that an individual might in bewilderment go ahead and do likewise? If I do not dare to speak freely, I will be completely silent about Abraham, above all I will not disparage him in such a way that precisely thereby he becomes a pitfall for the weak. For if one makes faith everything, that is, makes it what it is, then, according to my way of thinking, one may speak of it without danger in our age, which hardly extravagates in the matter of faith, and it is only by faith one attains likeness to Abraham, not by murder. If one makes love a transitory mood, a voluptuous emotion in a man, then one only lays pitfalls for the weak when one would talk about the exploits of love. Transient emotions every man surely has, but if as a consequence of such emotions one would do the terrible thing which love has sanctified as an immortal exploit, then all is lost, including the exploit and the bewildered doer of it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1095;"After all, in the poets love has its priests, and sometimes one hears a voice which knows how to defend it; but of faith one hears never a word. Who speaks in honor of this passion? Philosophy goes further. Theology sits rouged at the window and courts its favor, offering to sell her charms to philosophy. It is supposed to be difficult to understand Hegel, but to understand Abraham is a trifle. To go beyond Hegel's is a miracle, but to get beyond Abraham is the easiest thing of all.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1096;"I am not unacquainted with what has been admired as great and noble in the world, my soul feels affinity with it, being convinced in all humility that it was in my cause the hero contended, and the instant I contemplate his deed I cry out to myself, jam tua res agitur. I think myself into the hero, but into Abraham I cannot think myself; when I reach the height I fall down, for what I encounter there is the paradox.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1097;Philosophy cannot and should not give faith, but it should understand itself and know what it has to offer and take nothing away, and least of all should fool people out of something as if it were nothing.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1098;I am not unacquainted with the perplexities and dangers of life, I do not fear them, and I encounter them buoyantly.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1099; I have seen the dreadful before my own eyes, I do not flee from it timorously, but I know very well that, although I advance to meet it, my courage is not the courage of faith, nor anything comparable to it. I am unable to make the movements of faith, I cannot shut my eyes and plunge confidently into the absurd, for me that is an impossibility ... but I do not boast of it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1100;"When it is present to me, I am unspeakably blissful, when it is absent, I long for it more vehemently than does the lover for his object; but I do not believe, this courage I lack. For me the love of God is, both in a direct and in an inverse sense, incommensurable with the whole of reality. I am not cowardly enough to whimper and complain, but neither am I deceitful enough to deny that faith is something much higher. I can well endure living in my way, I am joyful and content, but my joy is not that of faith, and in comparison with that it is unhappy. I do not trouble God with my petty sorrows, the particular does not trouble me, I gaze only at my love, and I keep its virginal flame pure and clear. Faith is convinced that God is concerned about the least things. I am content in this life with being married to the left hand, faith is humble enough to demand the right hand - for that this is humility I do not deny and shall never deny.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1101;"All that time he believed - he believed that God would not require Isaac of him, whereas he was willing nevertheless to sacrifice him if it was required. He believed by virtue of the absurd; for there could be no question of human calculation, and it was indeed the absurd that God who required it of him should the next instant recall the requirement. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1102;"Abraham believed. He did not believe that some day he would be blessed in the beyond, but that he would be happy here in the world. God could give him a new Isaac, could recall to life him who had been sacrificed. He believed by virtue of the absurd; for all human reckoning had long since ceased to function.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1103;For, as I have said, Abraham I cannot understand, I can only admire him.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1104;They would suck worldly wisdom out of the paradox. Perhaps one or another may succeed in that, for our age is not willing to stop with faith, with its miracle of turning water into wine, it goes further, it turns wine into water.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1105;Only the lower natures forget themselves and become something new. Thus the butterfly has entirely forgotten that it was a caterpillar, perhaps it may in turn so entirely forget it was a butterfly that it becomes a fish. The deeper natures never forget themselves and never become anything else than what they were.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1106;Fools and young men prate about everything being possible for a man. That, however, is a great error. Spiritually speaking, everything is possible, but in the world of the finite there is much which is not possible.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1107;Let them croak in the swamp undisturbed.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1108;..passion is necessary. Every movement of infinity comes about by passion, and no reflection can bring a movement about.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1109;The ethical expression of what Abraham did is that he meant to murder Isaac, the religious expression is that he meant to sacrifice Isaac â€“ but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet, without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1110;I believe nevertheless that I shall get her, in virtue, that is, of the absurd, in virtue of the fact that with God all things are possible.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1111;Infinite resignation is the last stage before faith, so anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith, for only in infinite resignation does an individual become conscious of his eternal validity, and only then can one speak of grasping existence by virtue of faith.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1112;"Faith therefore is not an aesthetic emotion but something far higher, precisely because it has resignation as its presupposition; it is not an immediate instinct of the heart, but is the paradox of life and existence.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1113;For the act of resignation faith is not required, for what I gain by resignation is my eternal consciousness, and this is a purely philosophical movement which I dare say I am able to make if it is required, and which I can train myself to make, for whenever any finiteness would get the mastery over me, I starve myself until I can make the movement, for my eternal consciousness is my love to God, and for me this is higher than everything. For the act of resignation faith is not required, but it is needed when it is the case of acquiring the very least thing more than my eternal consciousnesses, for this is the paradoxical.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1114;In resignation I make renunciation of everything, this movement I make by myself, and if I do not make it, it is because I am cowardly and effeminate and without enthusiasm and do not feel the significance of the lofty dignity which is assigned to every man, that of being his own censor, which is a far proud er title than that of Censor General to the whole Roman Republic.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1115;"By faith I make renunciation of nothing, on the contrary, by faith I acquire everything, precisely in the sense in which it is said that he who has faith like a grain of mustard can remove mountains. A purely human courage is required to renounce the whole of the temporal to gain the eternal; but this I gain, and to all eternity I cannot renounce it - that is a self-contradiction.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1116;It goes against the grain for me to do what so often happens, to speak inhumanly about the great as if a few millennia were an immense distance. I prefer to speak humanly about it, as if it happened yesterday, and let only the greatness itself be the distance.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1117;One not infrequently hears it said by men, who for lack of losing themselves in studies are absorbed in phrases, that a light shines upon the Christian world whereas a darkness broods over paganism. This utterance has always seemed strange to me, inasmuch as every profound thinker and every serious artist is even in our day rejuvenated by the eternal youth of the Greek race. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1118;Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior - yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1119;Abraham is therefore at no instant a tragic hero but something quite different, either a murderer or a believer. The middle term which saves the tragic hero, Abraham has not. Hence it is that I can understand the tragic hero but cannot understand Abraham, though in a certain crazy sense I admire him more than all other men.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1120;The difference between the tragic hero and Abraham is clearly evident. The tragic hero still remains in the ethical.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1121;In our age we hear this cry seldom, for as our ago , to its disadvantage, does not produce heroes , it has also the advantage of producing few caricatures.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1122;"It is to bejudged according to the result, a man is at once clear as to who it is he has the honor of talking with. Those who talk thus are a numerous tribe, whom I will denominate by the common name of Docents.49 In their thoughts they live secure in existence, they have a solid position and sure prospects in a well-ordered state, they have centuries and even millenniums between them and the concussions of existence, they do not fear that such things could recur - for what would the police say to that! and the newspapers! Their lifework is to judge the great, and to judge them according to the result. Such behavior toward the great betrays a strange mixture of arrogance and misery: of arrogance because they think they are called to be judges; of misery because they do not feel that their lives are even in the remotest degree akin to the great.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1123;But what then is duty? Duty is precisely the expression for God's will. Here is evident the necessity of a new category if one would understand Abraham. Such a relationship to the deity paganism did not know. The tragic hero does not enter into any private relationship with the deity, but for him the ethical is the divine, hence the paradox implied in his situation can be mediated in the universal.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1124;Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1125;The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which from another angle means that it applies at all times. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing outside itself that is its Ï„Î­Î»Î¿Ï‚ but is itself the Ï„Î­Î»Î¿Ï‚ for everything outside itself, and when the ethical has absorbed this into itself, it goes not further. The single individual, sensately and psychically qualified in immediacy, is the individual who has his Ï„Î­Î»Î¿Ï‚ in the universal, and it is his ethical task continually to express himself in this, to annul his singularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the single individual asserts himself in his singularity before the universal, he sins, and only by acknowledging this can he be reconciled again with the universal. ... Faith [in contrast to the ethical] is namely this paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal ... so that after having been in the universal he as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1126;It is certainly true that many persons may be so constituted that they are repulsed by it, but faith ought not therefore to be made into something else to enable one to have it, but one ought rather to admit to not having it, while those who have faith ought to be prepared to set forth some characteristics the paradox can be distinguished from the spiritual trial.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1127;How did Abraham exist? He had faith. This is the paradox by which he remains at the apex, the paradox that he cannot explain to anyone else, for the paradox is that he as the single individual places himself in an absolute relation to the absolute. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1128;When in our age we hear these words: It will be judged by the result-then we know at once with whom we have the honor of speaking. Those who talk this way are a numerous type whom I shall designate under the common name of assistant professors.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1129;But we are curious about the result, just as we are curious about the way a book turns out. We do not want to know anything about the anxiety, the distress, the paradox. We carry on an esthetic flirtation with the result. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1130;"To explain the whole of existence and faith along with it, without having a conception of what faith is, is easy, and that man does not make the poorest calculation in life who reckons upon admiration when he possesses such an explanation; for, as Boileau says, ""un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire.""";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1131;"Faith is a marvel, and yet no human being is excluded from it; for that which unites all human life is passion, and faith is a passion.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1132;"Faith is a marvel, and yet no human being is excluded from it; for that which unites all human life is passion, and faith is a passion.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1133;In Hegelian philosophy, the outer (the externalization) is higher than the inner.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1134;Recent philosophy has allowed itself simply to substitute the immediate for â€œfaith.â€ if that is done, then it is ridiculous to deny that there has always been faith. this puts faith in the rather commonplace company of feelings, moods, idiosyncrasies, vagaries, etc. if so, philosophy may be correct in saying that one ought not to stop there. But nothing justifies philosophy in using this language. â€¦ Only when the individual has emptied himself in the infinite, only then has the point been reached where faith can break through.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1135;The true knight of faith is a witness, never a teacher, and therein lies his deep humanity, which is worth a good deal more than this silly participation in others' weal and woe which is honored by the name of sympathy, whereas in fact it is nothing but vanity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1136;Recognition and hiddenness are also an essential element of modern drama. â€¦ I assume that everyone who merely hears the word â€œhiddennessâ€ will easily be able to shake a dozen novels and comedies out of his sleeve. ... If someone playing the hiding game hides nonsense, we get a comedy, but if he is related to the idea, he may come close to being a tragic hero;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1137;Faust fulfills this idea. Anyone who has a notion of what it means for a person to live on spirit also knows what the hunger of doubt means and knows that the doubter hungers just as much for the daily bread of life as for the nourishment of spirit.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1138;"A man rouges his face and wears a periwig. The same man is eager to try his fortune with the fair sex, he is perfectly sure of conquering by the aid of the rouge and the periwig which make him absolutely irresistible. He captures a girl and is at the acme of happiness. Now comes the gist of the matter: if he is able to admit this embellishment, he does not lose all of his infatuating power; when he reveals himself as a plain ordinary man, and bald at that, he does not thereby lose the loved one.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1139;So either there is a paradox, that the individual as the individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute ... or Abraham is lost.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1140;Once when the price of spices in Holland fell, the merchants had a few cargoes sunk in the sea in order to jack up the price. Do we need something similar in the world of the spirit? Are we so sure that we have achieved the highest, so that there is nothing left for us to do except piously to delude ourselves into thinking that we have not come that far, simply in order to have something to occupy oneâ€™s time> is this the kind of self-deception the present age needs? Should it be trained in the virtuosity along that line, or is it not, instead adequately perfected in the art of deceiving itself?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1141;One must go further, one must go further. This impulse to go further is an ancient thing in the world.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1142;Faith is the highest passion in a man. There are perhaps many in every generation who do not even reach it, but no one gets further.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1143;Repetition and recollection are the same movement, except in opposite directions, for what is recollected has been, is repeated backward.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1144;Hope is a new garment, stiff and starched and lustrous, but it has never been tried on, and therefore one odes not know how becoming it will be or how it will fit. Recollection is a discarded garment that does not fit, however beautiful it is, for one has outgrown it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1145;"Repetition is an indestructible garment that fits closely and tenderly, neither binds nor sags. Hope is a lovely maiden who slips away between oneâ€™s fingers; recollection is a beautiful old woman with whom one is never satisfied at the moment; repetition is a beloved wife of whom one never wearies, for one only becomes weary of what is new. One never grows weary of the old, and when one has that, one is happy.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1146;"About a year ago, I became very much aware of a young man â€¦ [who was] at the captivating age in which spiritual maturity, just like physical maturity at a far earlier age, announces itself by a frequent breaking of the voice. â€¦ he told me he had fallen in love, I involuntarily thought that the girl who was loved in this way was indeed fortunate. He had been in love for some time now, concealing it even from me, but now the object of his desire was within reach; he had confessed his love and found love in return.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1147;I shall proceed to speak a little of the investigative journey I made to test the possibility and meaning of repetition. Without anyone knowing about it I went by steamship to Berlin.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1148;For a cultured person, seeing a farce is similar to playing the lottery, except that one does not have the annoyance of winning money.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1149;The experience of watching Beckmann perform â€” heâ€™s full of hilarity and joy â€“ then notices a young girl. â€œWhen I had watched Beckmann and let myself be convulsed with laughter, when I sank back in exhaustion and let myself be carried away on the current of jubilation and hilarity and then climbed out of the pool and returned to myself again, my eyes sought her, and the sight of her refreshed my whole being with its friendly gentleness. Or when in the farce itself a feeling of greater pathos burst forth, I looked at her, and her presence helped me to yield to it, for she sat composed in the midst of it all, quietly smiling in childlike wonder. She came there, as I did, every evening.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1150;A monotonous and unvarying order was established in my whole economy. Everything unable to move stood in its appointed place, and everything that moved went its calculated course: my clock, my servant, and I, myself, who with measured pace walked up and down the floor. Although I had convinced myself that there is no repetition, it nevertheless is always certain and that by being inflexible and also by dulling oneâ€™s powers of observation a person can achieve a sameness that has a far more anesthetic power than the most whimsical amusements and that, like a magical formulary, in the course of time also become more and more powerful.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1151;I can imagine that you will promptly take out my case history, as it were, and say: Right! Itâ€™s the fellow with the unhappy love affair. Where did we leave off?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1152;If I did not have Job I do not read him as one read another book, with the eyes, but I lay the book on my heart and read it with the eyes of the heart, in a clairvoyance interpreting ,,, Have you really read Job? Read him, read him again and again. I do not even have the heart to write one single outcry from him in a letter to you, even though I find my joy in transcribing over and over everything he has said, sometimes in Danish script and sometimes in Latin script, transcription of this kind is laid upon my sick heart as a Godâ€™s hand â€” plaster. Indeed, on whom did God lay his hand as on Job! But quote him â€” That I cannot do. That would be wanting to put my own pittance, wanting to make his words my own in the presence of another. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1153;I am doing my best to make myself into a husband. I sit and clip myself, take away everything that is incommensurable in order to become commensurable. Every morning I discard all the impatience and infinite striving of my soul â€” but it does not help, for the next moment it is there again. Every morning I shave off the beard of all my ludicrousness â€” but it does not help, for the next morning my beard is just as long again. I recall myself, just as the bank calls in its paper money in order to put new money in circulation â€” but it does not work. I convert my whole wealth of ideas, my mortgages, into matrimonial pocket money â€” alas! alas! In that kind of coin my wealth amounts to very little.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1154;Although I forsook the world long ago and renounced all theorizing, I nevertheless cannot deny that because of my interest in the young man he set me off my pendulum beat somewhat. It is easy to see that he is caught in a total misunderstanding. He is suffering from a misplaced melancholy high-minded that belongs nowhere except in a poetâ€™s brain. He is waiting for a thunderstorm that is supposed to make him into a husband, a nervous breakdown perhaps. It is completely the reverse. In fact, he is one of those who say: Battalion, about-face! â€” instead of turning around himself. This can be expressed in another way: the girl must go. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1155;"She is married â€” to whom I do not know, for when I read it in the newspaper I was so stunned that I dropped the paper and have not had the patience since then to check in detail. I am myself again. Here I have repetition; I understand everything, and life seems more beautiful to me than ever. It did indeed come like a thunderstorm, although I am indebted to her generosity for its coming. Whoever it is she has chosen â€” I will not even say preferred, because in the capacity of a husband any one is preferred to me â€” she has certainly shown generosity toward me. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1156;If it is assumed that anyone who reads a book for one or another superficial reason unrelated to the book is not a genuine reader, then there perhaps are not many genuine readers left even for authors with a large reading public. Who in our day thinks of wasting any time on the curious idea that it is an art to be a good reader, not to mention spending time to become that? Of course, this deplorable state has its effect on an author who, in my opinion, very properly joins Clement of Alexandria in writing in such a way that the heretics are unable to understand it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1157;In the course of time one grows weary of the perpetual patter about the universal, always universal, repeated to the most tedious extreme of insipidity. There are exceptions. If one cannot explain them, neither can one explain the universal.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1158;"There is talk of the good things of the world, of health, happy times, prosperity, power, good fortune, a glorious fame. And we are warned against them; the person who has them is warned not to rely on them, and the person who does not have them is warned not to set his heart on them. About faith there is a different kind of talk. It is said to be the highest good, the most beautiful;, the most precious, the most blessed riches of all, not to be compared with anything else, incapable of being replaced. Is it distinguished from the other good things, then, by being the highest but otherwise of the same kind as they are-transient and capricious, bestowed only upon the chosen few, rarely for the whole of life? If this were so, then it certainly would be inexplicable that in these sacred places it is always faith and faith alone that is spoken of, that it is eulogized and celebrated again and again.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1159;"If one person went to another and said to him, I have often heard faith extolled as the most glorious good: I feel though that I do not have it; the confusion of my life, the distractions of my mind, my many cares, and so much else disturbs me, but this I know, that I have but one wish, one single wish, that I might share in this faith.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1160;If by my wishing or by my gift I could bestow upon him the highest goodâ€ he said, â€œthen I could also take it from him, even if he would not have to be afraid of that. Worse yet, if I could do that, then the very moment I gave it to him I would be taking it from him, since by giving him the highest, I would be depriving him of the highest, because the highest was that he could give it to himself. Therefore, I will thank God that this is not the way it is.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1161;all who are expecting do have one thing in common, that they are expecting something in the future, because expectancy and the future are inseparable ideas. The person who is expecting something is occupied with the future.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1162;"How, then, shall we face the future? When the sailor is out on the ocean, when everything is changing all around him, when the waves are born and die, he does not stare down into the waves, because they are changing. He looks up at the stars. Why? Because they are faithful; they have the same location now that they had for our ancestors and will have for generations to come. By what means does he conquer the changeable? By the eternal, one can conquer the future, because the eternal is the ground of the future, and therefore through it the future can be fathomed. What, then, is the eternal power in a human being? It is faith. What is the expectancy of faith? Victory-or, as Scripture so earnestly and so movingly teaches us, that all things must serve for good those who love God.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1163;"â€œWhen the world commences its drastic ordeal, when the storms of life crush youthâ€™s exuberant expectancy, when existence, which seemed so affectionate and gentle, changes into a pitiless proprietor who demands everything back, everything that it gave in such a way that it can take it back-then the believer most likely looks at himself and his life with sadness and pain, but he still says, â€œThere is an expectancy that the whole world cannot take from me; it is the expectancy of faith, and this is victory. I am not deceived, since I did not believe that the world would keep the promise it seemed to be making to me, my expectancy was not in the world but in God.â€";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1164;"Knowledge of the truth I may perhaps have attained to; happiness certainly not. What shall I do? Accomplish something in the world, men tell me. Shall I then publish my grief to the world, contribute one more proof for the wretchedness and misery of existence, perhaps discover a new flaw in human life, hitherto unnoticed? I might then reap the rare reward of becoming famous, like the man who discovered the spots on Jupiter. I prefer, however, to keep silent.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1165;"If you had loved people then the earnestness of life might have taught you not to be strident but to become silent, and when you were in distress at sea and did not see land, then at least not to involve others in it; it might have taught you to smile at least as long as long as you believed anyone sought in your face an explanation, a witness. We do not judge you for doubting, because doubt is a crafty passion, and it can certainly be difficult to tear oneself out of its snares. What we require of the doubter is that he be silent. That doubt did not make him happy-why then confide to others what will make them just as unhappy.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1166;"An expectancy that without a specified time and place is nothing but a deception; In that way one may always go on waiting; such an expectancy is a circle into which the soul is bewitched and from which it does not escape. In the expectancy of faith, the soul is indeed prevented from falling out of itself, as it were, into multiplicity; it remains in itself, but it would be the worst evil that could befall a person if it escaped from this cycle.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1167;"When you had doubts about what came from God or about what was a good and perfect gift, did you risk the venture? And when the light sparkle of joy beckoned you, did you thank God for it? And when you were so strong that you felt you needed no help, did you then thank God? And when your allotted portion was little, did you thank God? And when you allotted portion was sufferings, did you thank God? And when your wish was denied, did you thank God? And when you yourself had to deny your wish, did you thank God? And when people wronged you and insulted you, did you thank God? We are not saying that their wrong thereby ceased to be wrong-what would be the use of such pernicious and foolish talk! It is up to you to decide whether it was wrong; but have you taken the wrong and insult to God and by your thanksgiving received it from his hand as a good and perfect gift? Did you do that?";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1168;"Did you keep the apostolic words holy? Did you treasure them in a pure and beautiful heart and refuse to be ransomed for any price or any wily bribe on the part of prudence, from the deep pain of having to confess again and again that you never loved as you were loved? That you were faithless when God was faithful; that you were lukewarm when he was ardent; that he sent good gifts that you perverted to your own detriment; that he inquired about you but that you would not answer; that he called to you but you would not listen; that he spoke cordially to you but you ignored it; that he spoke earnestly to you but you misunderstood it; that he fulfilled your wish and for thanks you brought new wishes; that he fulfilled your wish but you had made the wrong wish and were quick to anger?";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1169;What is it that is never changed even though everything is changed? It is love. And only that which never becomes something else is love, that which gives away everything and for that reason demands nothing, that which demands nothing and therefore has nothing to lose, that which blesses and blesses when it is cursed, that which loves its neighbor but whose enemy is also its neighbor, that which leaves revenge to the Lord because it takes comfort in the thought that he is even more merciful.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1170;Should I warn against a certain ingenious common sense that in human eyes is less culpable, that cunningly knows how to discover peopleâ€™s faults, that admittedly does not misuse its knowledge to condemn but nevertheless by its curiosity does not so much violate the neighbor as hinder itself. Should we admonish everyone to aspire to that Christian love because everyone so often needs forgiveness himself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1171;"When stinginess lives in the heart, when one gives with one eye and looks with seven to see what one obtains in return one readily discovers the multiplicity of sin. But when love lives in the heart, then the eye is never deceived, because when love gives, it does not watch the gift but keeps its eye on the Lord. When envy lives in the heart, the eye has the power to elicit the impure even from the pure; but when love lives in the heart, the eye has the power to love forth the good in the impure, but his eye sees not the impure but the pure, which it loves, and loves forth by loving it. Yes, there is a power in this world that in its language translates good into evil, but there is power from above that translates evil into good-it is the love that hides a multitude of sins. â€¦ When hate lives in the heart, sin is right there at the door of a human being, and the multitude of its cravings is present to him. But when love lives in the heart, then sin flees far away and he does not even catch a glimpse of it.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1172;"One must have the courage to will love; the secret of earthly love is that it bears the mark of Godâ€™s love, without which it would become silliness, or insipid philandering, as if a person in comparison with another were so perfect that he could arouse this anxiety or truly be able to take everything.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1173;"To remember everything is a great thing to the understanding; that love hides a multitude of sins is foolishness to it. Or should we deprive ourselves of this comfort by sensibly wanting to measure out love, so to speak, by wanting to portion it out as compensation for particular sins and in this way continue in the sins? Should we shut ourselves out from love; if we continue in love, who is it, then, who accuses? Or is not the love in a person that hides a multitude of sins from himself the same love that out of love hides a multitude of sins?";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1174;Only the person who cravingly runs away from every more profound explanation, who does not have the courage to assume the responsibility of the master by submitting to the obligation of a servant, who does not have the humility to be willing to obey in order to learn how to rule and at all times is willing to rule only insofar as he himself obeys-only he fills time with perpetual deliberations that takes him nowhere but only serves as a dissipation in which his soul, his capacity for comprehending and willing, vanishes like mist and is extinguished like a flame. How doleful is such a self-consuming, how far from witnessing by his life, from giving expression in his life, to a human beingâ€™s exalted destiny-to be Godâ€™s coworker.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1175;"Not until the moment when there awakens in his soul a concern about what meaning the world has for him and he for the world, about what meaning everything within him by which he himself belongs to the world has for him and he therein for the world-only then does the inner being announce its presence in this concern. This concern is not calmed by a more detailed or a more comprehensive knowledge; it craves another kind of knowledge, a knowledge that does not remain as knowledge for a single moment but is transformed into an action the moment it is possessed, since otherwise it is not possessed. This concern also craves an explanation, a witness, but of another kind.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1176;"Consider him the person who was wronged. He complains not about life but about people who corrupt everything and embitter what God made good. â€¦ Then everything became confused for him; there was no God who intended everything for good, but everything was left up to human beings who intended everything for evil. But the more his soul stared down into the abyss of dark passions that arose in him, the greater was the power that the anxiety of temptation gained over him, until he himself plunged down into it and lost himself in despair.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1177;"Blessed is the person who could truthfully say: God in heaven was my first love; blessed is the person whose life was a beneficent strengthening of his love; blessed is the person who, even though in his life he made the mistake of taking the outer instead of the inner, even though his soul in many ways was ensnared by the world, yet was again renewed in the inner being by turning back to his God.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1178;Jobâ€™s significance consists not in his having said it but in his having acted upon it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1179;"When one generation has finished its service, completed its work, fought through its struggle, Job has accompanied it; when the new generation with its incalculable ranks, each individual in his place, stands ready to begin the pilgrimage, Job is there again, takes his place, which is the outpost of humanity. If the generation sees nothing but happy days in prosperous times, then Job faithfully accompanies it; but if the single individual experiences the terrors in thought, is anguished over the thought of what horror and distress life can have in store, over the thought that no one knows when the hour of despair may strike for him, then his troubled thought seeks out Job, rests in him, is calmed by him, for Job faithfully accompanies him and comforts him, not, to be sure, as if he had suffered once and for all what would never be suffered again, but comforts as someone who witnesses that the horror has been suffered, the horror has been experienced, the battle of despair has been fought to the glory of God, for his own rescue, for the benefit and joy of others.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1180;"Only the person who has been tried and who tested the saying in being tested himself, only he rightly interprets the saying; Job desires only that kind of pupil, only that kind of interpreter; he alone learns from him what there is to learn, the most beautiful and the most blessed, compared with which all other art or wisdom is very inessential. Therefore, we quite rightly call Job a teacher of humankind and not of individuals, because he presents himself to everyone as the prototype.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1181; â€œThe Lord took away,â€ but first of all he said â€œThe Lord gaveâ€.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1182;If he [Job] had never known happiness, then the pain would not have overwhelmed him, for what is pain but an idea that the person knows nothing else does not have, but now it is precisely joy that has educated and developed him to perceive pain.â€;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1183;What had been his eyeâ€™s delight, his eyes craved to see again and his ingratitude punished him by inducing him to believe it to be more beautiful than it had ever been. What his soul delighted in, it now thirsted for, and ingratitude punished him by picturing it to him as more delightful than it had ever been. What he once had been able to do, he now wanted to be able to do again, and ingratitude punished him with fantasies that had never had any truth. Then he condemned his soul, living, to be starved out in the insatiable craving of the lack.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1184;"The Garden of Eden was closed; everything was changed, the man became afraid of himself, afraid of the world around him. Troubled he asked: What is the good, where is the perfect to be found? If it exists, where is its source? But the doubt that had come along with the knowledge coiled itself alarmingly around his heart, and the serpent that had seduced him with the delectable now squeezed him in its coils. Would he find out what the good and perfect is without learning where it came from, would he be able to recognize the eternal source without knowing what the good and perfect is? Doubt would explain to him first one thing, then another, and in the explanation itself would lie in wait for him in order to disquiet him still more. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1185;Does the fruit of the knowledge here again seem so delectable that instead of making a spiritual judgment you demand and identifying sign from the good and the perfect, a proof that it actually did come from above? How should such a sign be constituted?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1186;The apostle turns to the single individual in order to explain the condition that makes it possible for him to receive the good and perfect gift. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1189;God in heaven surely knows best what is the highest that a person can aspire to and complete. Scripture only asks if you were a trustworthy servant.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1190;"Every good and every perfect gift still comes down from above, and thus providence does not need specifically your treasure and your goods, since it always has twelve legions of angels ready to serve humankind. â€¦ You could just as well keep everything or give everything away; you still would not achieve or produce equality before God. All this I will give you if you will fall down and worship me. Have you forgotten that this was the tempter?";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1191;"When the rich man thanks God for the gift and for being granted the opportunity of bestowing it in a good way, he does indeed thank for the gift and for the poor man; when the poor man thanks the giver for the gift and God for the giver, he does indeed also thank God for the gift. Consequently equality prevails in the giving of thanks to God. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1192;A human being is born naked and brings nothing with him into the world, and whether the conditions of life are like friendly forms with everything in readiness or he himself must laboriously find them, everyone must nevertheless acquire the conditions of his life in one way or another. Even if this observation makes an individual impatient and thereby totally incompetent, yet the better people know how to comprehend this and how to conform to the idea that life must be gained and that it must be gained in patience, to which they admonish themselves and others, because patience is a soul strength that everyone needs to attain what he desires in life.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1193;The world can be possessed only by its possessing me, and this in turn is the way it possesses the person who has won the world, since one who possesses the world in any other way possesses it as the accidental, as something that can be diminished, increased, lost, won, without his possession being essentially changed. If, however, he possesses the world in such a way that the loss of it can diminish his possession, then he is possessed by the world.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1194;"whose possession, then, is his soul? Is it not the worldâ€™s, since illegitimate possession is no possession; it is not his, for he, of course, must gain it. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1195;Must he not possess his soul in order to have patience in which he gains his soul? Not at all, for patience comes into existence during the gaining, and in this gaining he does not become stronger and stronger, which must be assumed if he were to use force, but he seemingly becomes weaker and weaker. Precisely because the world possessed his soul illegitimately, the ultimate consequence of this, also because the world actually is the stronger, is that he becomes weaker and weaker in regard to the life of the world.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1196;Even though a person was not without education insofar as he learned from what he suffered, it still would never be very pleasant if he needed to suffer much in order to learn little. Its desire is to give thanks if on the word of authority it were to win the tacit permission of the multitude to dare to go its way unnoticed in order to find what it seeks: that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader, who with the right hand accepts what is offered with the right hand.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1197;You may have heard how someone who had thoughtlessly frittered away his life and never understood anything but wasted the power of his soul in vanities, how he lay on his sick bed and the frightfulness of disease encompassed him and the singularly fearful battle began, how he then for the first time in his life understood something, understood that it was death he struggled with, and how he then pulled himself together in a purpose that was powerful enough to move the world, how he attained marvelous collectedness for wrenching himself out of the sufferings in order to use the last moment to catch up on some of what he had neglected, to bring order to some of the chaos he had caused during a long life, to contrive something for those he would leave behind.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1198;"Let us praise what is truly praiseworthy, the glory of human nature; let us give thanks that it was granted also to us to be human beings; ... does not even a mentally handicapped person frequently demonstrate how strong a human being is, and yet we do not praise the mentally handicapped, even though he puts many to shame.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1199;If a person with troubled imagination conjured up anxieties he was unable to surmount, while he still could not leave off staring at them, evoking them ever more alarmingly, pondering them ever more fearfully, then we shall not praise him, even though we praise the wonderful glory of human nature. But if he brought out the horror and detected the mortal danger, without any thought of providing people, by pointless talk, with subject matter for pointless pondering, but grasped that the danger had to do with himself-if, then, with this in mind, he won the strength of soul that horror gives, this would in truth be praiseworthy, would in truth be wondrously wonderful.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1200;Since life is uncertain, there is something one desires to preserve, desires to safeguard for oneself. ... It could not be something temporal, inasmuch as for lifeâ€™s sake it probably would be desirable to preserve it, but how would one wish to preserve it for deathâ€™s sake, since it is precisely that which one abandons in death, which without envy and without preference would make everyone equal, equally poor, equally powerless, equally miserable, the one who possessed a world and the one who had nothing not love, the one who left behind a claim upon a world and the one who was in debt for a world, the one whom thousands obeyed and the one whom no one knew except death, the one whose loveliness was the object of peopleâ€™s admiration and the poor wretch who sought only a grave in order to hide from people. It would have to be something eternal, then, that the discourse was about or, more accurately, what it could truly be about, and, in a single word, what else could that be but a personâ€™s soul?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1201;"Spiritually, deliberation is a difficult and rather unrewarding labor. One dares leave nothing out in the fog, leave no little secret lying there in concealment. Perhaps one discovers that the tower cannot be as high as desired. Perhaps one had never seriously made a beginning on it and therefore did not really find out that one was incapable of doing it; but then one nevertheless had kept this dream in oneâ€™s soul, this seductive fantasy with which one could at times entertain oneself-why destroy it, since it nether injures nor benefits? One discovers a little defect in oneâ€™s work-well, the building could last for all that, just as well as all the others, because, after all, one does not build for an eternity-so why make difficulties for oneself? Suppose one discovered no irregularity at all, then why all this deliberation.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1202;"Does patience perhaps say with the cold calculation of the understanding that wishing is useless and that therefore one must stop wishing? Not at all; it does not speak about the fulfillment or nonfulfillment of the wish, for it says: Even if the wish were fulfilled, it would be to a personâ€™s loss; he would lose the best, the holiest, to be what God has intended him to be, neither more nor less.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1203;To preserve oneâ€™s soul in patienceâ€”that is, to keep the soul bound together in patience so that it does not go outside this and thereby become lost when he must begin the long battle with an indefatigable enemy, time, and with a multifarious enemy, the world.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1204;What is hope? An importunate pest one cannot get rid of, a cunning deceiver who holds out even longer than integrity, a cantankerous friend who always retains his rights even when the emperor has lost his. What is recollection? A troublesome comforter, a cowardly knave who wounds thee from behind, a shadow one cannot get rid of, even if someone would buy it. What is bliss? A wish one gives away to whoever wants to have it! What is friendship? A figment of the imagination, a superfluity, an added plague!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1205;"He who, believing, continues to aspire to the eternal never becomes satiated in such a way that he does not continue blessedly to hunger; he who hopefully looks to the future can never be petrified at some moment by the past, because he always turns his back to it; he who loves God and human beings still continually has enough to do, even when need is the greatest and despair is most imminent. Before he lies down to die, he asks once again: Do I love God just as much as before, and do I love the common concerns of human beings? If he dares to answer in the affirmative, then he does not die or he dies saved; if he dare not, then he certainly has enough to do. Then in love and for the sake of his love he must deliberate whether it is not possible to see, to glimpse, to presage the joy and comfort that still must hide in the sadness, since this must still truly serve him for good.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1206;"Patience has another phrase, a powerful phrase, just what the anxious one needs: This very day, (Luke 12.20 Hebrews 4.7) says the Lord. Let us not rashly venture to fathom deeply the mystery here; let us not become too engrossed in this phrase; but let us not forget, either, that it is there. Let us regard it as an angel of deliverance who stands there with his flaming sword, and every time the soul is about to rush out to the outermost boundary of despair it must pass by him; he judges the soul but also strengthens it. The phrase is like a mighty warrior who stands at the post on the outermost boundary of the kingdom, always engaged in that terrible border dispute. When people of the interior of the country have an intimation of the terror and the women and children rush out-he stands there, he soberly turns them back and says: Take courage; I am standing here, I never doze off; go home again, prepare your souls in patience and quiet alertness.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1207;Only the earthly and temporal mind, to its own deprivation, makes duplicitous that which in patience wants to be understood as comforting and alleviating and as rescuing and guiding in earnest.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1208;Is Anna not patient in expectancy? Anyone who wants to harvest before he sows or as soon as he has sown, anyone who wants to be victorious without struggling, anyone who wants something but does not want the means is a fool in peopleâ€™s eyes. Everyone believes that the expectant person needs some patience, and only the person who wants to cast away all patience, he alone is called impatient and childish in his impatience. Some patience! If a person were to go out into the world with this wisdom, he would find scarcely a single impatient person without some patience.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1209;â€œForget the past once again, quit all this calculating in which you trap yourself, do not stop the prompting of your heart, do not extinguish the spirit in useless quarreling about who waited the longest and suffered the most-once again cast all your sorrow upon the Lord and throw yourself upon his love. Up out of this sea, expectancy rises reborn again and sees heaven open-reborn, no newborn, for this heavenly expectancy begins precisely when the earthly expectancy sinks down powerless and in despair.â€;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1210;The error of the one doubting and the one despairing does not lie in cognition, since cognition cannot decide with certainty anything about the next moment, but the error lies in the will, which suddenly no longer wills but on the contrary wants to make the indeterminate into a passionate decision.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1211;"Whatever God gives, he â€œgives not the spirit of cowardliness but the spirit of power and self-control"". (2 Timothy 1.7) Just as it is required of the expectant person, if his expectancy is noble and worthy of a human being, that he seeks this spirit of power and self-control, and that, just as his expectancy is laudable, he must also be one who is properly expectant, so in turn will the object of expectancy, the more glorious and precious it is, form the expectant person in its own likeness, because a person resembles what he loves with his whole soul.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1212;Anyone who expects what truly pertains to him cannot thereby become indifferent to it, since then he no longer grasps that it truly pertains to him, and neither does he then expect that which truly pertains to him. He cannot become apathetic in habit, since at all times he is just as close to the fulfillment.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1213;Impatience is an evil spirit that can be expelled only by prayer and much fasting. â€¦ the hunger of impatience is not easy to satisfy-how, then, through fasting? The demands of impatience certainly use many words and long speeches, but in prayer it is very sparing with words.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1214;"People often lament that life is so impoverished, existence so powerless in all its magnificence, that it seeks in vain to take the soul by surprise or to captivate it in wonder, since to wonder at nothing is the highest wisdom, and to expect nothing is the highest truth. The child is astonished at insignificant things. The adult has laid aside childish things; he has seen the wondrous, but it amazes him no more; there is nothing new under the sun, and nothing marvelous in life. If, however, a person knew how to make himself truly what he truly is-nothing-knew how to set the seal of patience on what he had understood-ah, then his life, whether he is the greatest or the lowliest, would even today be a joyful surprise and be filled with blessed wonder and would be that throughout all his days, because there is truly only one eternal object of wonder-that is God-and only one possible hindrance to wonder-and that is a person when he himself wants to be something.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1215;"REMEMBER ALSO your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when you will say, ""I have no pleasure in them""";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1216;"REMEMBER ALSO your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when you will say, ""I have no pleasure in them""";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1217;"There is nothing in the wide world that is able to compensate a person for the harm he would inflict on his soul if he gave up the thought of God; but the person who demanded the highest, blinded though he was, still let it be understood that in a certain imperfect sense he grasped the significance of what he was abandoning.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1218;Think about your Creator in the days of your youth. One does this best and most naturally in youth, and if anyone kept the thoughts of youth through all the rest of his life-well, then he would have accomplished a good work.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1219;"There was a thinker who became a hero by his death; he said that he could demonstrate the existence of God with a single straw.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1220;When a person grows older he often scrutinizes his thoughts and retards himself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1221;"For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1222;"It may be a merit of our present age that in many ways it has known how to work the wish weary and in that way to wean the soul from wishing; it may be to its advantage if it thereby has developed an honest earnestness that for the good renounces the fraudulence of wishes. We do not reproach the age for having made the idea of the power of the wish into playing with words if it thereby motivates someone to work with his own hands instead of with the borrowed energy of the wish. But the wish for heavenâ€™s salvation-is this, too, a play on words, as wishing for heavenly help has become for the frivolous, who thinks that we ought to depend on God the way we depend on people â€“that is, if you help yourself then God does the rest. And if the wish for heavenâ€™s salvation has become playing with words, has the aim in it been to incite people to work all the harder to gain it? This seems not at all to be the case.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1223;"Salvation is a matter of course; nothing follows in turn from it. Therefore, let us not waste time by first making doubtful something that is a matter of course, and then by allying the doubt that never brings the assurance one has when one lets it come as a matter of course, this point of view still does not deny that heavenâ€™s salvation is a good and can disapprove of the wish for it only insofar as the wish already is a kind of unnecessary concern, since salvation is a matter of course whether one wishes it or not.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1224;The thought of heavenâ€™s salvation dare not become a matter of indifference to a person. How would salvation become a matter of indifference to him for whom the discourse need not venture out to the outermost boundary of thoughtlessness, but whose soul is well educated to hear the serious words of earnestness â€œthat God is not mockedâ€ (Galatians 6:7), whose soul is prepared by considering what presumably would completely overwhelm the confused, â€œthat no one can serve two masters, since he must hate the one and love the otherâ€ (Matthew 6:24), whose soul is fully awakened from sleep to understand what presumably would hurl the sleepwalker into the abyss, â€œthat love of the world is hatred of God!â€ (James 4.4) has the spiritual sense to be disgusted at the thought that heavenâ€™s salvation, despite it gloriousness, could be nonsense, has the maturity of understanding to grasp that heavenâ€™s salvation can no more be taken by force than it can be redeemed like a fine in a game of forfeits. Such a person has the time to consider the one thing needful, the heart to wish for heavenâ€™s salvation, the earnestness to reject the flirting of light-minded ideas, the fear and trembling in his soul to be terrified at the thought of breaking with heaven or of taking it in vain.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1225;Experience certainly has long known how to think of some cheer for the troubled, but, as is natural, it does not know a joy that passes all understanding. Experience knows all the many inventions of the human heart, but a rapture that did not arise in any manâ€™s heart it does not know.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1226;The expectancy of an eternal salvation will reconcile everyone with his neighbor, with his friend, and with his enemy in an understanding of the essential.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1227;Even though the concern did not provide a person humble entrance, it is still worth endeavoring to gain it so that there may be an inwardness, a hallowed place in the soul, where the consciousness retreats, lets the world go, incloses itself in itself, becomes reconciled with itself and thereby with the differences in life, an inclosure where thoughts of finitude, insofar as they presumptuously want to force entry, are found every morning to be overthrown, like Dagonâ€™s statue at the foot of the Ark of the Covenant, before the sublimity of the concern that is solely concerned about the intrinsically valid, and that is not the expectation that wants to enter heaven triumphantly and wants its festive entrance to be decisive for others.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1228;Is not heavenâ€™s salvation so great a good that it needs no increment by means of some external circumstance? The person who has salvation certainly can neither wish to become more blessed by some irrelevant thought nor wish to be disturbed by any irrelevant thought. If a person thinks that his salvation is assured nevertheless thinks something like this, it simply shows that he is not thinking about salvation, and this other thought may very well make him lose salvation, just as the consciousness of the good deed causes one to lose the reward.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1229;If one was not what in a more elevated way is called a simple man, but what in plain, everyday speech is called a real simpleton, and you, my listener, were a wise person who profoundly asked, â€œWhat is truth?â€ and restlessly pondered the question with competence and success-do you suppose it would disturb you if he became just as blessed as you and heavenâ€™s infinite salvation made you both equal?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1230;"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice; therefore this joy of mine is now full. He must increase, but I must decrease.""";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1231;A person should not, if life is to have deeper meaning, become accustomed to understanding everything in general, should not be in a hurry to understand everything, but should patiently follow the pointer that continually points to himself. And even though in every other sense it is just a figurative expression to say that we see the finger of God in life, a person who is concerned about himself understands it quite literally, because all deeper and more inward self-knowledge sees the finger of God that points to him. To miss one letter confuses the whole world, and yet this confusion is nothing compared with the confusion that occurs when a person, in understanding life in its totality and the history of the human race, skips over one human being-himself-since the individual human being is, after all, not like a single letter, in itself a meaningless part of the word, but is the whole world. And yet this happens very frequently, and therefore very little is learned from life.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1232;"The same thing that happened to the greatest among those born of women also happens to lesser ones; what happens in the unique decision also happens in the lesser ones, and the words are not profanely used by learning from them to compose oneself in the lesser situation of oneâ€™s own life.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1233;"We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1234;Every human being is only an instrument and does not know when the moment will come when he will be put aside. If he himself does not at times evoke this thought, he is a hireling, an unfaithful servant, who is trying to free himself and to cheat the Lord of the uncertainty in which he comprehends his own nothingness. That much in life is empty and worthless, people certainly do know, but how frequently the single individual makes an exception, and even the highest mission in the spiritual world is only an errand, and one who is equipped for it with all spiritual-intellectual gifts is only on an errand-but why is the sending out of angels so beautiful, inasmuch as they return again to Godâ€™s throne so speedily that they have no time to be tempted by the thought that they are taking care of their own affairs!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1235;"John remained true to himself; precisely when his disciplesâ€™ news seemed to call for a different response, he gave witness to them of that which he had proclaimed in the wilderness before the coming one appeared and had preached to the people. He requested them to witness along with him that this had been his witness from the beginning, and the disciples had to witness along with him that this witness was his conclusion, his yes and amen.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1236;"How many roads there are in the hour of decision! And yet, there is only one road; the others are wrong roads, whether they lead to the place where envy concocts its plans, where grief has its haunts, where the worm of desire does not die, where disconsolateness stares at its loss, where mockery alarms others with its vile wisdom, or where the tongue of slander betrays the abundance of the heart-all these roads lead away, far away, and thought does not even dare to follow them.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1237;"He must increase-who is this â€œheâ€? In the sense in which we have used the word, everyone can identify him with another name; this is how change occurs here on earth; one increases and another decreases, and today it is I and tomorrow you. But one who in humble self-denial and with genuine joy saw another increase-his mind will be turned into a new joy, and this new joy of his will surely be full. â€¦ An old saying states that everyone would rather see the rising sun than the setting sun. Why everyone? Do you suppose this includes someone whose sun it is that is setting? Yes, for he, too, ardently desires to rejoice just as the bridegroomâ€™s friend does when he stands and hears the bridegroomâ€™s voice.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1238;this little book [â€¦] seeks that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader, in order to pay him a visit, indeed, to stay with him, because one goes to the person one loves, makes oneâ€™s home with him, and remains with him if this is allowed.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1239;"â€œA person needs only a little in order to live and needs that little only a little whileâ€-this is a high minded proverb that is worthy of being received and understood as it wants to be understood; it is too earnest to want to be admired as a beautiful expression or an elegant locution. As such it is thoughtlessly used at times: one calls it out to the needy person, perhaps in order to console him in passing, perhaps also just to have something to say; one says it to oneself, even on a lucky day, since the human heart is very deceitful, is all too eager to take high-mindedness in vain and is proud of needing only a little-while using much. One says it to oneself on a day of need, and hurries ahead to welcome oneself admiringly at the goal-when one has accomplished something glorious-but one is as little served thereby as the proverb is.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1240;To be contented with the grace of God! The grace of God is indeed the most glorious of all. We certainly shall not dispute about that, since basically this is every human beingâ€™s deepest and most blessed conviction. But very seldom does he think about it and ultimately, if he really wants to be honest, yet without being quite clear himself about what he is doing, he applies to this idea that old proverb: Too little and too much spoil everything. If he were to think the thought in its eternal validity, it would promptly aim a fatal blow at all his worldly thinking, aspiring, and pursuing, turn everything upside down, and this he cannot long endure. Then he relapses to the low level of the worldly, to his ordinary conversation and way of thinking.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1241;With respect to the earthly, one needs little, and to the degree that one needs less, the more perfect one is. A pagan who knew how to speak only of the earthly has said that the deity is blessed because he needs nothing, and next to him the wise man, because he needs little. In a human beings relationship to God, it is inverted: the more he needs God, the more deeply he comprehends that he is in need of God, and then the more he in his need presses forward to God, the more perfect he is. [â€¦]it is the saddest thing of all if a human being goes through life without discovering that he needs God.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1242;"We do not deny that wanting in all earnestness to understand what a person does not yet understand earnestly enough-if he wants to seek his own way to this consciousness and not leave it to God, who knows best how to alarm all self-confidence out of a person and keep him, when he is about to sink into his own nothingness, from maintaining by himself the diverâ€™s connection with the earthly-we do not deny that wanting in all earnestness to understand this makes life difficult. Let us just admit it without thereby becoming so discouraged or cowardly that we want to sleep our way to what others have had to work for; let us not take it in vain when the believer enthusiastically declares that all his suffering is only brief and short, that the yoke of self-denial is beneficial, that the cross of sufferings ennobles a person more than anything else, and let us hope to God that someday we shall come so far that we, too, are able to speak enthusiastically. Let us not demand this too early, lest the believerâ€™s zealous words discourage us because this does not occur immediately.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1243;To external observation, many may well be the most glorious creation, but all his glory is still only in the external and for the external: does not the eye aim its arrow outward every time passion and desire tighten the bowstring, does not the hand grasp outward, is not his arm stretched out, and is not his ingenuity all-conquering!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1244;"But if he nevertheless is unwilling to be an instrument of war in the service of inexplicable drives, indeed, in the service of the world, because the world itself, the object of his craving, stimulates the drive; if he nevertheless does not want to be like a stringed instrument in the hands of inexplicable moods or, rather, in the hands of the world, because the movement of the soul is in accord with the way the world plucks its strings; if he does not want to be like a mirror in which he intercepts the world or, rather, the world reflects itself; if he does not want this, if he himself, even before the eye aims at something to make a conquest, wants to capture the eye so that it may belong to him and not he to the eye; if he grasps the hand before it grasps for the external, so that it may belong to him and not he to the hand; if he wants this so earnestly that he is not afraid of tearing out the eye, cutting off the hand, shutting the window of the senses if necessary-well, then everything is changed: the power is taken away from him, and the glory. He struggles not with the world but with himself.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1245;"Did not Moses go as the Lordâ€™s envoy to the wicked people in order to free them from themselves, from their servile mentality, and from their servile condition under the tyrantâ€™s yoke? Compared with what are called the works of Moses, what is the deed of even the greatest hero; what are demolishing mountains and filling rivers compared with having darkness fall upon all Egypt? But these were really only Mosesâ€™ so-called works, because he was capable of nothing at all and the work was the Lordâ€™s. See the difference here. Moses-he is not making decisions and formulating plans while the council of the commonsensical listens attentively because the leader is the wisest-Moses is capable of nothing at all.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1246;"If this view, that to need God is manâ€™s highest perfection, makes life more difficult, it does this only because it wants to view man according to his perfection and bring him to view himself in this way, because in and through this view man learns to know himself. And for the person who does not know himself, his life is, in the deeper sense; indeed a delusion. But such a delusion is rarely due to a personâ€™s not discovering the capabilities entrusted to him, to his not trying to develop them as much as possible in conformity with his given situation.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1247;"The more profound self-knowledge begins with what someone who is unwilling to understand it might call a shocking delusion: instead of becoming the master, to become one in need; instead of being capable of all things, to be capable of nothing at all. Ah, how difficult it is at this point not to fall into dreams again and to dream that one is doing this by oneâ€™s own power.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1248;There is danger afoot-both of them, both the first self and the deeper self, notice it, and the latter sits there as concerned as the experienced pilot, while a secret council is held on whether it is best to throw the pilot overboard since he is creating a contrary wind. That, however, does not happen, but what is the outcome? The first self cannot move from the spot, and yet, yet it is clear that the moment of joy is in a hurry, that fortune is already in flight. Therefore people do indeed say that if one does not make use of the moment at once, it is soon too late. And who is to blame? Who else but the deeper self? But even this scream does not help. What kind of unnatural condition is this? What does it all mean?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1249;When the first self submits to the deeper self, they are reconciled and walk on together.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1250;"In the external world, he is capable of nothing; but in the internal world, is he not capable of anything there, either? If a capability is actually to be a capability, it must have opposition, because if it has no opposition, then it is either all-powerful or something imaginary. But if he is supposed to have opposition, from whence is it supposed to come? In the internal world the opposition can only come from himself. Then he struggles with himself in the internal world, not as previously, where the deeper self struggled with the first self to prevent it from being occupied with the external. If a person does not discover this conflict, his understanding is faulty and consequently his life is imperfect; but if he does discover it, then he will once again understand that he himself is capable of nothing at all. Every time a person properly comprehends this brief and pithy truth, that he himself is capable of nothing at all, then he knows himself.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1251;"We sometimes speak of learning to know God from the history of past ages; we take out the chronicles and read and read. Well, that may be all right, but how much time it takes, and how dubious the outcome frequently is, how close at hand the misunderstanding that lies in the sensate personâ€™s marveling over what is ingenious! But someone who is conscious that he is capable of nothing at all has every day and every moment the desired and irrefragable opportunity to experience that God lives. If he does not experience it often enough, he knows very well why that is. It is precisely because his understanding is faulty and he believes himself capable of something.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1252;"We are not saying that knowing God or almost sinking into a dreaming admiration and a visionary contemplation of God is the only glorious thing to do; God does not let himself be taken in vain in this way. Just as knowing oneself in oneâ€™s own nothingness is the condition for knowing God, so knowing God is the condition for sanctification of a human being by Godâ€™s assistance and according to his intention. Wherever God is in truth, there he is always creating. He does not want a person to be spiritually soft and to bathe in the contemplation of his glory, but in becoming known by a person he wants to create in him a new human being.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1253;Since the importance of Holy Scripture is to be an interpreter of the divine to mankind, since its claim is to want to teach the believer everything from the beginning, it follows of itself that its language has shaped the discourse of the God-fearing about the divine, that its words and expressions resound again and again in the holy places, in every more solemn discourse about the divine, whether the speaker seeks to interpret the scriptural text by letting the text speak for itself or is using the scriptural expression in all its brevity as the clear and complete interpretation of the much he has said. But also in everyday and secular speech we sometimes hear a scriptural expression that has wandered from the sacred out into the world â€¦ One such biblical expression frequently encountered where least expected and at times put to a most inappropriate use is the phrase just read: the thorn in the flesh.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1254;Has God ever made a covenant with a person regarding the external?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1255;We must warn here against wanting to play the hero, against wanting to be a warrior at oneâ€™s own expense, against wanting to be oneâ€™s own teacher who determines the degree of suffering and calculates the advantages. We must warn that no one is tried in a self-made conflict but is only cultivated in a new vanity so that the last becomes worse than the first. But then we are also reminded that suffering is a component and no one enters the kingdom of heaven without suffering. Just to be reminded of it is instructive, lest the distress of spiritual trial come upon one as unexpectedly as a thief in the night, as birth pangs to one who had no presentiment of giving birth.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1256;"Let everyone test himself. With regard to what he has experienced, let him be true to himself, but let no one forget that blessedness of the spirit and suffering of the spirit are not something external of which one can honestly and truly say: The circumstances of my life did not provide me the opportunity to experience this. In the world of the spirit, there is neither sport nor spook; there luck and chance do not make one person a king, another a beggar, one person as beautiful as an Oriental queen, another more wretched than Lazarus. In the world of the spirit, the only one who is shut out is the one who shuts himself out; in the world of the spirit, all are invited and therefore what is said about it can be said safely and undauntedly; if it pertains to one single individual it pertains to all. Why, then, this curiosity about what God has given every human being the opportunity to experience, indeed, has been made so available that it even may be said: He must have understood it.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1257;Woe to the person who wants to be excused from suffering! That apostolic expression does not indicate only the forsakenness, the suffering of separation, which is even more terrible than the separation of death, since, death only separates a person from the temporal and therefore is a release, whereas this separation shuts him out from the eternal and therefore is an imprisonment that again leaves the spirit sighing in the fragile earthen vessel, in the cramped space, in the status of an alien, because the home of the spirit is in the eternal and the infinite. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1258;The eternal fears no future, hopes for no future, but love possesses everything without ceasing, and there is no shadow of variation. As soon as he returns to himself, he understands this no more. He understands what bitter experiences have only all too unforgettably inculcated, the self-accusation, if the past has the kind of claim upon his soul that no repentance can entirely redeem, no trusting in God can entirely wipe out, but only God himself in the inexpressible silence of beatitude. The more of the past a personâ€™s soul can still keep when he is left to himself, the more profound he is.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1259;If faith acquired a probability, then everything would be destroyed and faith would be confused, since this would show that it had not performed the preliminary task and therefore has allowed itself to be confounded with thoughtlessness, which comes most easily to the animal.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1260;Bold confidence is a difficult matter, because it is not exactly synonymous with mental weakness. One may very well stop with it and need not go further by even wishing to judge God, that is, if in other respects bold confidence is bold confidence in the judgment, which certainly requires that Godâ€™s judgment penetrate the thought and heart, that is, if it is bold confidence in Godâ€™s mercy and these words are not a feigned pious expression of oneâ€™s own thoughtlessness, which does not trust God but is consoled by having ceased to sorrow long ago. If no human being is capable of acquitting himself he is capable of one thing-of indicting himself so terribly that he cannot acquit himself but learns to need mercy. With regard to this, it is difficult for one person to understand another, because the earnest person always lays the stress on himself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1261;"We have been speaking about the thorn in the flesh; we have tried to explain the expression in a general sense, that is, in the general sense in which, by pertaining to one single individual, it pertains to all. We have not been particularly concerned about ferreting out what Paul may have particularly had in mind with this expression, and we have desired least of all to ask about it in the sense that someone might ask whether Paul was tall or short, handsome, and the like. We are especially unwilling to suggest the possible accidental something, the possible insignificant something, that may be the single individualâ€™s thorn in the flesh.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1263;It is humble to admit that the struggle, even through no fault of oneâ€™s own, drags out so that every day has its evening, and because of oneâ€™s fault drags out in such a way that twilight sometimes falls on defeat. It is humble to admit that even the progress through life of the most honest contender is difficult, that even the person who walks his way with firm steps nevertheless does not walk with a heroâ€™s pace, indeed, that when the evening of life cools the contender after the long day there still is no opportunity for fanfare, since even the person who came closest to the goal does not arrive with the qualifications or the disposition for the rigors of a victory celebration but, weary and worn, desires a grave in which to rest and a blessed departure from here in peace.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1264;"Pride and cowardliness are one and the same because what is spoken under the name pride is ordinarily cowardliness. False pride conjures a high conception of oneâ€™s own worth. The proud person always wants to do the right thing, the great thing, and he is actually struggling not with people but with God, because he wants to do it with his own power; he does not want to sneak out of something, what he wants is to set the task as high as possible and then to finish it by himself, satisfied with his own consciousness and his own approval. The proud person must concentrate all his thought in order to see the right; he must will it, because he is too proud to admit that people could be in the right in opposition to him, even if no one could convince him of that.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1265;"Cowardliness is the most pleasant of all passions; it is not noisy and strident, but quiet and suggestive and yet lustful, it attracts all the passions to itself, since in its association with them it is extremely engaging, knows how to maintain a friendship with them, and buries itself deep in the soul like somnolent vapor of stagnant water, which pestiferous breezes and deceptive phantoms rise, while the vapor still remains. What cowardliness fears most is the making of a resolution, because a resolution always disperses the vapor for a moment. The power cowardliness prefers to conspire with is time, because neither time nor cowardliness finds that there is any reason to hurry.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1266;If the resolution is not the beginning and the beginning the resolution, then the final account can never be rendered, because in a certain sense there is none. If there is no resolution there will be no tower, however imaginary or however really splendid the estimate was! The good resolution is to will to do everything in oneâ€™s power, so serve it to the utmost of oneâ€™s capability.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1267;"Every human being should not just learn by rote but learn very particularly, that he is nothing-which some learn by recognizing that what they are capable of is as good as nothing, others by recognizing that what they are not capable of is as good as nothing but is sufficient to make all their capability essentially nothing. The extensive enterprise can often be dazzling enough, especially when it is not only glorious and lauded by men but beneficial for many, and yet it is only a mirage; the resolution is not the good resolution until the person gives himself and everything up to the good, all his weaknesses, and leaves it up to God. The mirage is due to a personâ€™s becoming a worthy servant in his own eyes, an important instrument, but this is not the good resolution. The good resolution is satisfied with being the unworthy servant. Therefore every person is to test himself.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1268;Cowardliness prevents a person from acknowledging the good that he does do.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1269;"When one suffers misjudgment it is easy for one to become more self-important; he does not judge others but he wants his deeds to judge others and in a crafty way. He wants to build up a larger balance with God. He is not content with being an unworthy servant; he wants to be a little more than that.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1270;Is it not a good deed to restrain the arm of someone who wants to commit a misdeed, and is it not also a good deed to restrain the judgment of someone who wants to misjudge and cannot judge otherwise if acknowledgment of the good does not prevent it? Much wrong can be done to a person, but perhaps the worst is to come with belated repentance over a rash, unjust judgment that one nevertheless has oneself helped to occasion. As you can see, if this happens, if a person goes astray in this way by doing the good, he can thank himself and cowardliness, because God gives a spirit of power of love, and of self-control. [â€¦] Do not do the good ashamedly and with downcast eyes, as if you were walking a forbidden road, acknowledge it even though you are ashamed because you always feel your own imperfection and lower your eyes before God. Venture it in trust in God. Let each one acknowledge the good, renewed in his resolution, never led astray by any jugglery that it is more difficult to serve the good when one is misjudged. How would it help for it to be more difficult if it was also less true or for it to be more difficult for many if it was easier for him?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1271;"A random word collects a crowd; the easily bought victory makes them enthusiastic, but the more profound explanation puts them off, and if the price is what it must be in relation to the highest, then mockery gives the signal for retreat and gives the retreat the appearance of a glorious victory. Does not mockery always gain the highest at a bargain price! And yet how despicable to want to think that the price of the highest and most sacred, just like the price of temporal things, should be determined by an accident, by the scarcity or the abundance of the commodity in the country. On the other hand, how upbuilding it is to consider that this is not the case and that someone who fancies that he has bought the highest at a low price is simply mistaken, since the price is always the same. How sure and cheerful and resolute the soul becomes in the thought that no price is too high when that which one is buying is the highest.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1272;"Without fail, the good has its reward, but if the â€œreward-hungryâ€ sensate person wanted to do the good for that reason, would he ever put it into practice? No, the soul must make a resolution in renunciation of all calculating, all sagacity and probability; it must will the good because it is good, and then it will certainly perceive that it has its reward; it must continue in duty because it is duty, the then it will thereby really feel the security; it must will to be reconciled with its opponent out of the unreckoning impulse of the heart, and then the good fight of reconciliation will also win for him the affection of the vanquished.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1273;If one person makes comprehensible to another something that is to his advantage in the temporal sense and the latter acts accordingly, then the former may be said to have brought it about. If, however, a person tries to make comprehensible to another his eternal well-being, this does not help straightaway in the same manner, inasmuch as the second still has not grasped the eternal on the basis of what the first said. If, however, he makes the eternal resolution and in it grasps the eternal, then he owes no one anything, not the speaker either.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1274;"No human being can give an eternal resolution to another or take it from him; If someone objects to that then one might just as well be silent if there is no probability of winning others, he thereby has merely shown that although his life very likely thrived and prospered in probability and everyone of his undertakings in the service of probability went forward, he has never really ventured and consequently has never had or given himself the opportunity to consider that probability is an illusion, but to venture the truth is what gives human life and the human situation pith and meaning, to venture is the fountainhead of inspiration, whereas probability is the sworn enemy of enthusiasm, the mirage whereby the sensate person drags out time and keeps the eternal away, whereby he cheats God, himself, and his generation: cheats God of the honor, himself of liberating annihilation, and his generation of the equality of conditions.""";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1275;A person can wrong another human being with his prayer, and prayer in this manner is a terrible weapon between man and man, perhaps the most pernicious. The strong man is warned not to misuse his power against the weak, but the weak man is also warned not to misuse the power of prayer against the strong. It may well be that a tyrant who misused his power, a deceiver who misused his shrewdness, never perpetrated as atrocious a wrong as the one who cowardly and slyly prayed in the wrong place, prayed in order to advance his will, flung himself in to the weakness of prayer, into imploring misery, in order to shatter another person.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1276;"Then the Comforter comes with the explanation; then he makes everything new, strips the sufferer of his mourning apparel and gives him a new heart and an assured spirit. It may, however, take time.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1277;The struggle goes on for an explanation, and prayer is the means by which the explanation will correspond to the way he prays about it. One person struggles with all his might against the explanation that would make himself guilty-no, it was all dispensation providence, all from God in order to test, to purify, to try the lover. Another struggles in order that the explanation may explain his guilt to him, so that the passage of freedom will not seem an illusion, but that the chasmic separation of guilt may make the blessedness of reconciliation all the more inward. One person asks that the explanation will unite him to the race and that the explanation will lie in the fate common to all, which is meaningful for the whole, another that the explanation will consider him outside the relation of others in order to select him for solitary pain, but also for solitary election.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1278;"Alas, the debt someone incurs at the gambling table, by throwing dice, in a game of cards, is called a debt of honor; I suppose that because it is meaningless in itself we have to give it an impressive name and then hurry to be rid of it. The debt to God is not a debt of honor like that, but it is, nevertheless, an honor to be in debt to God. It is an honor not to owe fortune anything, but to owe God everything; not to owe fate anything, but to owe providence everything; not to owe caprice anything, but to owe a fatherliness everything.-In this way, he who prays aright struggles in prayer and is victorious in that God is victorious.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1279;Propositio: The question is asked in ignorance, by one who does not even know what can have led him to ask it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1280;"How far does the Truth admit of being learned? (â€¦)For what a man knows he cannot seek, since he knows it; and what he does not know he cannot seek, since he does not even know for what to seek. Socrates thinks the difficulty through in the doctrine of Recollection, by which all learning and inquiry is interpreted as a kind of remembering; one who is ignorant needs only a reminder to help him come to himself in the consciousness of what he knows. Thus the Truth is not introduced into the individual from without, but was within him.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1281;I always reason from existence, not toward existence, whether I move in the sphere of palpable sensible fact or in the realm of thought. I do not for example prove that a stone exists, but that some existing thing is a stone. The procedure in a court of justice does not prove that a criminal exists, but that the accused, whose existence is given, is a criminal.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1282;"The God has thus made his appearance as Teacher (for we now resume our story), and has assumed the form of a servant. To send another in his place, one high in his confidence, could not satisfy him; just as it could not satisfy the noble king to send in his stead even the most trusted man in his kingdom. But the God had also another reason; for between man and man the Socratic relationship is the highest and truest. If the God had not come himself, all the relations would have remained on the Socratic level; we would not have had the Moment, and we would have lost the Paradox. The Godâ€™s servant-form however is not a mere disguise, but is actual; it is not a parastatic body but an actual body; and from the hour that in the omnipotent purpose of his omnipotent love the God become a servant, he has so to speak imprisoned himself in his resolve, and is now bound to go on (to speak foolishly) whether it pleases him or no.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1283;"If this fact has been naturalized, birth is no longer merely birth, but is at the same time a new birth, so that one who has never before been in existence is born anew -- in being born the first time. In the individual life the hypothesis of naturalization is expressed in the principle that the individual is born with faith; in the life of the race it must be expressed in the proposition that the human race, after the introduction of this fact, has become an entirely different race, though determined in continuity with the first. In that event the race ought to adopt a new name; for there is nothing inhuman about faith as we have proposed to conceive it, as a birth within a birth (the new birth); but if it were as the proposed objection would conceive it, it would be a fabulous monstrosity.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1284;"A good man wishes to serve humanity by presenting a probability-proof, so as to help it accept the improbable. He is successful beyond all measure; deeply moved, he receives congratulations and addresses of thanksgiving, not only from the quality, who know";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1285;"The projected hypothesis indisputably makes an advance upon Socrates, which is apparent at every point. Whether it is therefore more true than the Socratic doctrine is an entirely different question, which cannot be decided in the same breath, since we have here assumed a new organ: Faith; a new presupposition: the consciousness of Sin; a new decision: the Moment; and a new Teacher: the God in Time. Without these I certainly never would have dared present myself for inspection before that master of Irony, admired through the centuries, whom I approach with a palpitating enthusiasm that yields to none. But to make an advance upon Socrates and yet say essentially the same things as he, only not nearly so well -- that at least is not Socratic.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1286;"In the scholarly world much is made of classifying literature and assigning the writing of each individual author to its proper place in the age and the writing of the age and in that of the human race. Yet no one thinks about what might be gained if one or another literary type could be trained to read only prologues, but to do it so thoroughly that he would begin with the earliest times and advance through all the centuries down to our own day. Prologues are characterized by the accidental, like dialects, idioms, colloquialisms; they are dominated by fashion in a way entirely different from the way works are-they change like clothing.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1287;By paying attention to the opinion of the visible reading public and of the usual reviewers, one falls into the most fatuous confusion.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1288;For the cultured it is truly too little to have to deal with an individual human being, even though that human being is himself. He does not want to be disturbed when he is to be built up, does not want to be reminded of all the trifles, of individuals, of himself, because to forget all this is precisely the upbuilding. The life of the congregation, the grand definition of the system, the purely human-all of which he does not tempt the individual to think about himself or want to finish something, but builds him up only by his thinking it over-are the subject for consideration in the present work. It is again this totality toward which it strives. The cultured person thus seeks the congregation, to call to mind a word of the poet to whom the present devotional work is so very much indebted and whom I do myself the honor of naming as the authority and as the chosen bard of the cultured, the pondering Professor Heiberg.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1289;does not philosophy teach that if the infinite is thought outside the finite, then both become finitudes? Is it not repeated again and again: truth is the criterion of itself and of the false? Then if philosophy excludes something it renders itself finite. In order to prevent this, it must be willing to explain itself more specifically with regard to my obtuseness and what constitutes it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1290;when the philosopher becomes blessed through his philosophy, this is an accidental blessedness. There is, then, something higher than philosophy. It is higher in that it includes me and similar bunglers. If this is so, then the question is: will philosophy continue to be called the absolute? But if it is not the absolute, then it must be able to state its boundary. If I wanted to be a poet, the esthetician would certainly instruct me about which capacities are required for that. I would then perceive that I am not a poet and would accept my fate. If, on the other hand, poetry wanted to claim to be the absolute, then it would not dare to exclude me, because the absolute cannot be anything that is not common to all.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1291;Each generation has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations. Just as each dayâ€™s trouble is sufficient for the day, so each individual in a generation has enough to do in taking care of himself and does not need to embrace the whole contemporary age with his paternal solicitude or assume that era and epoch begin with his book, and still less with the New Yearâ€™s torch of his promise or with the intimations of his farseeing promises or with the referral of his reassurance to a currency of doubtful value. Not everyone who is stoop-shouldered is an Atlas, nor did he become such by supporting a world. Not everyone who says Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven. Not everyone who offers himself as surety for the whole contemporary age proves by such action that he is reliable and can vouch for himself. Not everyone who shouts Bravo, schwere, Noth, Gottblitz, bravissimo has therefore understood himself and his admiration.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1292;In logic, no movement must come about, for logic is, and whatever is logical only is. The external expression for the logical is what the Eleatics through a misunderstanding transferred to existence: nothing comes into being, everything is.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1293;The Genesis story presents the only dialectically consistent view. Its whole content is really concentrated in one statement: Sin came into the world by a sin. Were this not so, sin would have come into the world as something accidental, which one would do well not to explain. The difficulty for the understanding is precisely the triumph of the explanation and its profound consequence, namely, that sin presupposes itself, that sin comes into the world in such a way by the fact that it is, it is presupposed.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1294;One who has properly occupied himself with psychology and psychological observation acquires a general human flexibility that enables him at once to construct his example which even though it lacks factual authority nevertheless has an authority of a different kind. The psychological observer ought to be more nimble than a tightrope dancer in order to incline and band himself to other people and imitate their attitudes, and his silence in the moment of confidence should be seductive and voluptuous, so that what is hidden may find satisfaction in slipping out to chat with itself in the artificially constructed nonobservance and silence.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1295;The concept of race is too abstract to allow the positing of so concrete a category as sin, which is posited precisely in that the single individual himself, as the single individual, posits it. Thus sinfulness in the race becomes only a quantitative approximation.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1296;If a person does not first make clear to himself the meaning of â€œself,â€ it is of no use to say of sin that it is selfishness. Only when the concept of the particular is given can there be any talk of selfishness, however, no science can say what the self is without stating it quite generally. And this is the wonder of life, that each man who is mindful of himself knows what no science knows, since he knows who he himself is, and this is the profundity of the Greek saying know yourself, which too long has been understood in the German way as pure self-consciousness, the airiness of idealism.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1297;Man is a synthesis of psyche and body, but he is also a synthesis of the temporal and the eternal. In the former, the two factors are psyche and body, and spirit is the third, yet in such a way that one can speak of a synthesis only when the spirit is posited. The latter synthesis has only two factors, the temporal and the eternal. Where is the third factor? And if there is no third factor, there really is no synthesis, for a synthesis that is a contradiction cannot be completed as a synthesis without a third factor, because the fact that the synthesis is a contradiction asserts that it is not. What, then, is the temporal?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1298;Spiritlessness can say exactly the same thing that the richest spirit has said, but it does not say it by virtue of spirit. Man qualified as spiritless has become a talking machine, and there is nothing to prevent him from repeating by rote a philosophical rigmarole, a confession of faith, or a political recitation. Is it not remarkable that the only ironist and the greatest humorist joined forces in saying what seems the simplest of all, namely, that a person must distinguish between what he understands and what he does not understand.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1299;There is only one proof of spirit and that is the spiritâ€™s proof within oneself. Whoever demands something else may get proofs in superabundance, but he is already characterized at spiritless.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1300;Life offers sufficient phenomena in which the individual in anxiety gazes almost desirously at guilt and yet fears it. Guilt has for the eye of the spirit the fascinating power of the serpentâ€™s glance.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1301;"Nay, truthâ€”which abhors also this untruth of aspiring after broad dissemination as the one aimâ€”is not nimble on its feet. In the first place it cannot work by means of the fantastical means of the press, which is the untruth; the communicator of the truth can only be a solitary individual. And again the communication of it can only be addressed to the individual.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1302;The demonstration of the existence of God is something with which one learnedly and metaphysically occupies oneself only on occasion, but the thought of God forces itself upon a man on every occasion. What is it that such an individuality lacks? Inwardness.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1303;"If a human being were a beast or an angel, he could not be in anxiety. Because he is a synthesis, he can be in anxiety; and the more profoundly he is in anxiety, the greater is the manâ€”yet not in the sense usually understood, in which anxiety is about something external, about something outside a person, but in the sense that he himself produces the anxiety. Only in this sense can the words be understood when it is said of Christ that he was anxious unto death, as well as the words spoken by Christ to Judas: What you are going to do, do quickly.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1304;It may be judged how important is The Concept of Dread from the fact that besides the German translation there are two translations in French and one in Spanish. It is the first time I have had the pleasure of comparing four translations with the original text. It is hard on the eyes to keep five texts in view when I am making my translation, but it is interesting. I soon discovered to my chagrin that the Spanish translation was made, not from the Danish, but from Schrempfâ€™s translation, and therefore could be discarded. The translator had not emulated the noble example of Don Miguel de Unamuno, who said in one of his essays, â€œI learned the language for the sake of reading Ibsen and was rewarded by reading Kierkegaard.â€ Because this translator was only a hack hired by a publisher, his name is not given. But of the French translations, which were both published in 1935 and are therefore entirely independent, it would be churlish of me to say that they are not very good, seeing that I have profited much by both of them.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1305;â€¦ this little book [â€¦] seeks that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call my reader, or it does not even seek him. Unaware of the time and the hour, it quietly waits for that right reader to come like the bridegroom and to bring the occasion along with him. Let each do a share-the reader therefore more.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1306;"Father in heaven, how well we know that seeking always has its promise; how much the more, then, seeking you, the giver of all the promises and of all good gifts! How well we know that the seeker does not always need to wander out into the world, because the more holy that is which he seeks, the closer it is to him, and if he seeks you, O God, you are closest of all to him! But we also know that seeking always has its toil and its spiritual trial-how much more, then, the terror in seeking you, you Mighty One!";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1312;"There is a government loan officer where the poor can go. The indigent person is helped, but do the poor have a joyful conception of this loan office? Likewise, there perhaps are marriages that seek God only in adversity, alas, and seek him as a loan office; and anyone who only then seeks him always runs this danger. Would such a late resolution, which even though worthy is still not bought at the last moment without shame and without great danger-would it be more beautiful and wiser than the first resolution of marriage?";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1313;The person who is without God in the world soon becomes bored with himself-and expresses this haughtily by being bored with all life, but the person who is in fellowship with God indeed lives with the one whose presence gives infinite significance to even the most insignificant.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1314;Time also is a good.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1315;Earnestness understands the same thing about death but understands it in a different way.

1316;See, one can have an opinion about remote events, about a natural object, about nature, about scholarly works, and about another human being, and so on about much else, and when one expresses this opinion the wise person can decide whether it is correct or incorrect.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1317;"What a splendid occupation to prepare a secret for oneself, how seductive to enjoy it, and yet at times how precarious to have enjoyed it, how easy for it to miscarry for one. In other words, if someone believes that a secret is transferable as a matter of course, that it belongs to the bearer, he is mistaken, for the [riddle] â€œOut of the eater comes something to eatâ€ is valid here; but if anyone thinks that the only difficulty entailed in enjoying it is not to betray it, he is also mistaken, for one also takes on the responsibility of not forgetting it. Yet it is even more disgusting to recollect incompletely and to turn oneâ€™s soul into a transit warehouse for damaged goods.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1323;I shall speak in praise of woman. Just as the person who is supposed to talk about the divine must be inspired by the divine in order to be able to talk worthily and therefore is taught what he is to say by the divine himself, so it is also with speaking about woman. Woman, even less than the god, is a whim from a manâ€™s brain, a daydream, something one hits upon all by oneself and argues about pro et contra. No, only from her herself does one learn to talk about her.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1327;"A positive resolution has only one risk-not to be true to itself; a negative resolution always has a double danger: not to be true to itself, which resembles the danger in the positive resolution with the one difference that all this faithfulness is without reward, is a faded glory and as barren as a bachelorâ€™s life; and then the second risk-whether all this faithfulness whereby one is true to oneself in oneâ€™s negative resolution is not a deviation that for all its faithfulness is eventually rewarded with repentance.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1328;In that little book [On the Nobility and Excellence of the Female Sex, and the Superiority of the Same over the Male Sex, by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, 1486â€“1535] it is adduced as proof that in Hebrew woman is called Eve (life), man is called Adam (earth) â€“ ergo. Something like this is excellent as a jest in an exchange of words in which everything is absolutely decided and signed and sealed with both the notary publicâ€™s seal and Godâ€™s. So it is also when the author cites in another demonstration that when a woman falls into the water she floats on top whereas a man, if he falls into the water, sinks-ergo. This demonstration lends itself to other uses, which helps explain the fact that so many witches were burned in the Middle Ages. It is a few years since I read that little book, but it was highly amusing to me. The most comical things in the natural sciences and philology appear in the most naÃ¯ve way.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1329;Is an author less rich in ideas because ordinary observation finds nothing, while the reader who has made him his sole study nevertheless discovers an ever-greater wealth? Is it a perfection in human works of art that they look best at a distance? Is it an imperfection in the meadow flower, as in all the works of God, that under microscopic scrutiny it becomes lovelier and lovelier, more and more exquisite, more and more delicate?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1330;"Nowadays woman is continually characterized in the highest terms, in the most flattering phrases, up to, indeed, far beyond the fantastic. Everything that is great in life is ascribed to her; on this point poetry and gallantry agree.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1331;A resolution must be added to falling in love. But a resolution presupposes reflection, but reflection is immediacyâ€™s angel of death. So it stands, and if it was right that reflection should attack falling in love, then there will never be a marriage. But that is precisely what it should not do-indeed, what is more, even prior to and simultaneously with this process, which through reflection comes to a resolution, there is the negative resolution that fends off any reflection of this nature as a spiritual temptation. While reflectionâ€™s destroying angel of death ordinarily goes about calling for death to the immediate, there is still one immediacy it allows to stand-the immediacy of falling in love, which is a wonder.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1332;The religious abstraction desires to belong to God alone;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1333;Importunity toward God is a kind of impertinent camaraderie, even if he himself does not understand it that way. He can even be truly humble, but in the very same way, humanly speaking, a subordinate can have the most loyal enthusiasm for his king and be far superior to those who are neither hot nor cold but are numbers and cattle, but yet when he seeks an audience with the king he can wish to be permitted to enter through a door different from the one assigned to all subjects. To me it seems that there must be something terrible about his being turned away and hearing those words: The other way, then we shall see what can be done.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1334;"What gives the lake an even more inclosed look is that the quagmire is thickly overgrown with reeds; indeed, there is nothing like it in Denmark, at least so says my friend the naturalist. Only in one place has a little waterway been opened up; here, there is a flat-bottomed boat, in which we two, he on behalf of science and I on behalf of friendship and curiosity, poled ourselves out. With effort we brought the boat out, for the channel has hardly a foot of water.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1335;The naturalist sat totally absorbed in his work, asking just once if I had found anything, a question that did not seem to expect a reply since he quite appropriately did not regard my fishing as being on behalf of science. Well, I had not found what he was searching for, either, but something totally different. And so each of us sat in his end of the boat, each one occupied with his find, he for the sake of science, and I for the sake of friendship and curiosity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1336;My father was married, and he was the most depressed person Iâ€™ve known.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1337;Why do I feel happier in the distance of possibility?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1338;A year ago today. Is this how it is to be engaged? I knew what it is to be in love, that I knew-but this new thing, to be convinced that the object of love is secured, that she is mine, mine forever. Is this the way it is to be a mother? wailed Rachel when the twinsâ€™ struggle began in her womb, and many a person presumably has said this to himself when he obtained what he craved: Is this the way it is? And is it not as if there were two natures struggling within me: have I become ten years older or have I become ten years younger?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1339;"Spiritually I shall always be able to be something for her. We shall then, both of us, grow older; there indeed comes a time when youth does not crave in the same way, and then in a distinctive sense our love will have the years ahead of it. Or is, then, the most enviable love that whose most beautiful was when the lovers could sweep out onto the floor in a waltz? She is reserved, quiet, entirely calm; when someone is present, she is as cheerful as ever.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1340;For what is it to have spirit but to have will, and what is it to have will but to have it beyond all measure, since the person who does not have it beyond all measure but only to a certain degree does not have it at all.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1341;With a sword hanging over my head, in peril of my life, I discover the religious crisis with a primitivity such as if I had not known of them before, with such a primitivity that if they had not been I would have to discover them.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1342;It is comic that a mentally disordered man picks up any piece of granite and carries it around because he thinks it is money, and in the same way it is comic that Don Juan has 1,003 mistresses, for the number simply indicates that they have no value. Therefore, one should stay within oneâ€™s means in the use of the word â€œlove.â€;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1343; A year ago today. It has happened. In two days I have already managed to introduce that terrible word into the course of conversation. There is an enormous difference when a warship and a nutshell put out to sea, and the difference is externally visible. It is different with words. The same word can indicate an even greater difference, and yet the word is the same. The word has not come up between us in a pathos-filled way, but it comes up again and again, mixed in among various things in order to clarify the mood.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1344;Lessing was indeed wrong in saying that the swiftest thing of all, swifter than the sound and light, is the transition from good to evil, for even swifter is das Zugleich, the all-at-once. Indeed, transition itself is a time, that that which is all-at-once is swifter than any transition. Transition is still a qualification of time, but the speed with which that which once was and never is forgotten is present, although it was indeed present: that speed is the swiftest of all, for it is so swift that its being absent is, of course, but an illusion.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1345;"Here the diary ends for the time being. It deals with nothing, yet not in the sense of Louis XVIâ€™s diary, the alternating contents of which are supposed to have been: on one day, went hunting; the second day, rein [nothing]; the third day, went hunting. It contains nothing, but if, as Cicero says, the easiest letters deal with nothing, then sometimes it is the hardest life that deals with nothing.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1346;It is a contradiction to be willing to sacrifice oneâ€™s life for a finite goal, and in the eyes of poetry such behavior is comic, akin to dancing oneself to death or wanting to walk with spurs when one is bowlegged and falls down on them and is killed-rather than quit wearing spurs. Oh, what an enticing task for a comic poet, but without passion, no poet, no comic poet either.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1347;Does it help one to believe in what is great by knowing it is historical?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1348;To Repent of Nothing Is the Highest Wisdom-the Forgiveness of Sin. Hand in hand with such negative principles as: Admire nothing, expect nothing, etc. is the negative principle: Repent of nothing or, to use other words that perhaps are not as ethically disturbing: Regret nothing. The real secret of this wisdom is that an esthetic principle has been embellished and given the appearance of an ethical principle. Understood esthetically from an ethical position this is entirely true, for the free spirit essentially ought not to esteem the whole range of the esthetic so highly that he regrets something. For example, if someone has become poor, then it is correct to say: To regret nothing is the highest wisdom-that is, act by virtue of the ethical. Then the principle means: continually to cut down the bridge of the past behind one in order continually to be able to act at the moment.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1349;But I must ask you Socrates, what do you suppose is the upshot of all this? As I said a little while ago, it is the scrapings and shavings of argument, cut up into little bits.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1350;Philosophical Fragments was only supposed to clothe the issue in historical costume. The issue was the difficulty. Without wanting to affront anyone, I am of the opinion that not every young graduate in theology would have been capable of presenting the issue with even the same dialectical rhythm with which it is done in the pamphlet. I am also of the opinion that not every young graduate in theology, after reading the pamphlet would be able to set it aside and then on his own to present the issue with just the same dialectical clarity with which it is elucidated in the pamphlet.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1351;Although an outsider, I have at least understood this much, that the only unforgivable high treason against Christianity is the single individualâ€™s taking his relation to it for granted.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1352;inspiration is indeed an object of faith, is qualitatively dialectical, not attainable by means of quantification;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1353;The more objective the observer becomes, the less he builds an eternal happiness, that is, his eternal happiness, on his relation to his observation, because an eternal happiness is a question only for the impassioned, infinitely interested subjectivity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1354;"It is Christianity itself that attaches an enormous importance to the individual subject; it wants to be involved with him, him alone, and thus with each one individually. What has been intimated here has been emphasized in Fragments frequently enough, namely, that there is no direct and immediate transition to Christianity, and therefore all those who in that way want to give a rhetorical push in order to bring one into Christianity or even help one into it by a thrashing-they are all deceivers-no, they know not what they do.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1355;We have become so objective that even the wife of a civil servant argues from the whole, from the state, from the idea of society, from geographic scientificity to the single individual.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1356;The speculative thinker just wants to look at Christianity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1357;Not even Satan himself is able, as a third party, to say anything with definitness as a third party. However, God can never become a third party when he is part of the religious. The more objective the world and individual subjectivities become, the more difficult it becomes with the religious categories, which are precisely in the sphere of subjectivity. That is why it is almost an irreligious exaggeration to want to be world-historical, scholarly-scientific, and objective with regard to the religious.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1358;Not even Satan himself is able, as a third party, to say anything with definitness as a third party. However, God can never become a third party when he is part of the religious.

1359;"Socrates is standing and gazing into space; then two passers-by come along and one says to the other: What is that man doing? The other replies: Nothing. Let us suppose that one of them has a little more of an idea of inwardness. He describes Socrates action as a religious expression and says: He is absorbed in the divine; he is praying. Let us concentrate on the latter expression â€œHe is praying.â€ But is he using words, perhaps ever so many words? No Socrates understood his God-relationship in such a way that he did not dare to say anything at all for fear of talking a lot of nonsense and for fear of having a wrong desire fulfilled.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1360;Truth is subjectivity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1361;"It is subjectivity that Christianity is concerned with, and it is only in subjectivity that its truth exists, if it exists at all; objectively, Christianity has no existence.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1362;The basis of the paradox of Christianity is that it continually uses time and the historical in relation to the eternal.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1363;Contingent truths of history can never become the demonstrations of necessary truths of reason.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1364;When someone is to leap he must certainly do it alone and also be alone in properly understanding that it is an impossibility. â€¦ the leap is the decision.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1365;"A system that is not entirely finished is a hypothesis, whereas a half-finished system is nonsense and a fragment of a system is also nonsense. Consequently, (a) a logical system can be given; (b) but a system of existence cannot be given.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1366;But who is the systematic thinker? Well, it is he who himself is outside existence and yet in existence, who in his eternity is forever concluded and yet includes existence within himself-it is God.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1367;"Let me be as if created for the sake of a whim; this is the jest. Yet I shall with the utmost strenuousness will the ethical; this is the earnestness.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1368;Philosophy (Hegel) seeks speculatively to confuse the ethical for the single individual with the world-historical task for the human race. The ethical is the highest task assigned to every human being.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1369;To God, world history is the royal stage where he, not accidentally but essentially, is the only spectator, because he is the only one who can be that. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1370;If in my relationship with God I regard what I am doing as good and do not keep watch over myself with the infiniteâ€™s mistrust of me, then it is just as if God, too, were content with me, because God is not something external, but is the infinite itself, is not something external that quarrels with me when I do wrong but the infinite itself that does not need scolding words, but whose vengeance is terrible-the vengeance that God does not exist for me at all, even though I pray. To pray is an action.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1371;What does it mean to die? What does it mean to be immortal? What does it mean to marry? I am indeed the one who continually says that between the simple personâ€™s and the wise personâ€™s knowledge of the simple there is only the ludicrous little difference-that the simple person knows it, and the wise person knows that he knows it or knows that he does not know it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1372;When an assistant professor, every time his coattails reminds him to say something, says de omnibus dubitandum est [everything must be doubted] and briskly writes away on a system in which there is sufficient internal evidence in every other sentence that the man has never doubted anything-he is not considered lunatic.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1373;"He wants to convince [others] that he is not a lunatic and therefore paces up and down the floor and continually says, ""Boom! The Earth is round!"". But is the earth not round? ... is he a lunatic, the man who hopes to prove that he is not a lunatic by stating a truth universally accepted and universally regarded as objective?";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1374;Here is such a definition of truth: An objective uncertainty, held fast through appropriation with the most passionate inwardness, is the truth, the highest truth there is for an existing person. At the point where the road swings off (and where that is cannot be stated objectively, since it is precisely subjectivity), objective knowledge is suspended. Objectively he then has only uncertainty, but this is precisely what intensifies the infinite passion of inwardness, and truth is precisely the daring venture of choosing the objective uncertainty with the passion of the infinite. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1375;The speculative thinker believes only to a certain degree-he puts his hand to the plow and looks around in order to find something else to know. In a Christian sense, what he finds to know is hardly anything good.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1376;Every human being is spirit and truth is the self-activity of appropriation.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1377;The inwardness of truth is not the chummy inwardness with which two bosom friends walk arm in arm with each other but is the separation in which each person for himself is existing in what is true.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1378;"The Christian truth as inwardness is also upbuilding but this by no means implies that every upbuilding truth is Christian; the upbuilding is a wider category.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1379;The presence of irony does not necessarily mean that the earnestness is excluded. Only assistant professors assume that.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1380;Hegelian philosophy culminates in the thesis that the outer is the inner and the inner is the outer. With this, Hegel has finished. â€¦ The religious definitely establishes the contrast between the outer, and the inner, which is defined as contrast.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1381;Existing is something quite different from knowing;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1382;Abstraction does not care about whether a particular existing human being is immortal, and just that is the difficulty. It is disinterested, but the difficulty of existence is the existing personâ€™s interest, and the existing person is infinitely interested in existing.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1383;Be cautious with an abstract thinker who not only wants to remain in abstractionâ€™s pure being but wants this to be the highest for a human being, and wants such thinking, which results in the ignoring of the ethical and a misunderstanding of the religious, to be the highest human thinking.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1384;"THE Cartesian cogito ergo sum [I think therefore I am] has been repeated often enough. If the I in cogito is understood to be an individual human being, then the statement demonstrates nothing: I am thinking ergo I am, but if I am thinking, no wonder, then, that I am; after all, it has already been said, and the first consequently says even more than the last. If, then, by the I in cogito, one understands a single individual existing human being, philosophy shouts: Foolishness, foolishness, here it is not a matter of my I or you I but of the pure I. But surely this pure I can have no other existence than thought-existence.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1385;"God does not think, he creates; God does not exist, he is eternal.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1386;It is not denied that with regard to evil there are cases in which the transition is almost undetectable, but these cases must be explained in a special way. This is due to the fact that the individual is so in the power of habit that by frequently having made the transition from thinking to acting he has finally lost the power for it in the bondage of habit, which at his expense makes it faster and faster.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1387;Ethics has been shoved out of the system and has been replaced with a surrogate that confuses the world-historical and the individual and confuses the bewildering, bellowing demands of the times with the eternal demands of conscience upon the individual.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1388;"The subjective thinker is not a scientist-scholar; he is an artist. To exist is an art. The subjective thinker is esthetic enough for his life to have esthetic content, ethical enough to regulate it, dialectical enough in thinking to master it. The subjective thinkerâ€™s task is to understand himself in existence. â€¦ To understand oneself in existence is the Christian principle, except that this self has received much richer and much more profound qualifications that are even more difficult to understand together with existing.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1389;Just as an old man who has lost his teeth now munches with the help of the stumps, so the modern Christian language about Christianity has lost the power of the energetic terminology to bite-and the whole thing is toothless â€œmaundering.â€ To me it is clear that the confusion in Christianity is due to its having been set back one whole stage in life. That we become Christians as children has promptly given rise to the assumption that one is what has been anticipated potentially.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1390;One says: To renounce everything is an enormous abstraction-that is why one must proceed to hold on to something. But if the task is to renounce everything, what if one began by renouncing something?;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1391;"Revelation is marked by mystery, eternal happiness by suffering, the certitude of faith by uncertainty, easiness by difficulty, truth by absurdity; if this is not maintained, then the esthetic and the religious merge in common confusion. â€¦ The religious lies in the dialectic of inwardness deepening and therefore, with regard to the conception of God, this means that he himself is moved, is changed. An action in the eternal transforms the individualâ€™s existence.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1392;The secular mentality will say that poetry is a maidenâ€™s over-excitement, religiousness a manâ€™s frenzy.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1393;The highest His Imperial Highness is able to do, however, is to make the decision before God. The lowliest human being can also make his decision before God.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1394;"Irony is the cultivation of the spirit and therefore follows next after immediacy; then comes the ethicist, then the humourist, then the religious person.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1395;Someone absolutely in love does not know whether he is more in love or less in love than others, because anyone who knows that is definitely not absolutely in love. Neither does he know that he is the only person who has truly been in love, because if he knew that, he would not be absolutely in love-and yet he knows that a third party cannot understand him, because a third party will understand him generally in relation to an object of passion but not in relation to the absoluteness of passion.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1396;The religious does not dare to ignore what occupies other peopleâ€™s lives so very much, what continually comes up again every day in conversations, in social intercourse, in books, in the modification of the entire life view, unless the Sunday performances in church are supposed to be a kind of indulgence in which with morose devoutness for one hour a person buys permission to laugh freely all week long. â€¦ it shows far greater respect for the religious to demand that it be installed in its rights in everyday life rather than affectedly to hold it off at a Sunday distance.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1397;The self-deceived person may even think he is able to console others who became victims of perfidious deception, but what insanity when someone who himself has lost the eternal wants to heal the person who is extremely sick unto death!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1398;If anyone thinks he is a Christian and yet is indifferent toward being that, he is not one at all. When Christ says (Matthew 10:17), â€œBeware of people,â€ I wonder if by this is not also meant: Beware of being tricked out of the highest by people, by continual comparison, by habit and by externals.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1399;"By the sensuous, the flesh, Christianity understands selfishness. A conflict between spirit and flesh is inconceivable unless there is a rebellious spirit on the side of flesh, with which the spirit then contends; similarly, a conflict between spirit and a stone or between spirit and a tree is inconceivable.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400;God is the middle term. Only by loving God above all else can one love the neighbor. Love for the neighbor is therefore the eternal equality in loving. Equality is simply not to make distinctions and eternal equality is unconditionally not to make the slightest distinction, unqualifiedly not to make the slightest distinction. The essential Christian is itself too weighty, in its movements too earnest to scurry about, dancing, in the frivolity of such facile talk about the higher, highest, and the supremely highest.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1401;The times are past when only the powerful and the prominent were human beingsâ€”and the others were bond servants and slaves. This is due to Christianity.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1402;"The measure of a person's disposition is this: ... how great is the distance between his understanding and his actions. Basically we all understand the highest. A child, the simplest person, and the wisest all understand the highest. ... But what makes the difference is whether we understand it at a distanceâ€”so that we do not act accordingly, or close at handâ€”so that we act accordingly and ""cannot do otherwise.""";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1403;I has no significance until it becomes the you to whom eternity incessantly speaks and says: you shall, you shall, you shall.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1404;"A man who had two sons ... went to the first and said, ""Son, go out and work in my vineyard today."" But he answered and said, ""I will not,"" but afterward he repented of it and he went. And the father went to the second and said the same. But he answered, ""I will, sir,"" and he did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father?";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1405;"If you want to be well off and yet easily manage to become something, then forget God, never let yourself really become aware, never let it become really clear to you that it is he who has created you from nothing; proceed on the presupposition that a human being does not have time to waste on keeping in mind the one to whom he infinitely and unconditionally owes everything. ... Forget it and be noisy along with the crowd, laugh or cry, be busy from morning until night, be loved and respected and esteemed as a friend, as a public official, as a king, as a pallbearer. Above all be an earnest person by having forgotten the one and only earnestness, to relate yourself to God, to become nothing.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1406;"If your ultimate and highest goal is to have life made easy and sociable, then never become involved with Christianity, shun it, because it wants the very opposite; it wants to make your life difficult and to do this by making you alone before God. No earnest person, therefore, wearies of tracking down the illusions, because insofar as he is a thinking person he fears most to be in error, however cozy the arrangement is, however good the companyâ€”and as a Christian he fears most to be lost without knowing itâ€”however flattering, however splendid the surroundings and the company are.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1407;The relationship between the individual and God, the God-relationship, is the conscience.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1408;There are a you and an I, and there is no mine and yours! For without a you and an I, there is no love, and with mine and yours there is no love but â€œmineâ€ and â€œyoursâ€ (these possessive pronouns) are, of course, formed from a â€œyouâ€ and an â€œIâ€ and as a consequence seem obliged to be present wherever there are a you and an I. This is indeed the case everywhere, but not in love , which is a revolution from the ground up. The more profound the revolution, the more completely the distinction â€œmine and yoursâ€ disappears, and the more perfect is the love.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1409;"Yet only in self-denial can one effectually praise love, because God is love, and only in self-denial can one hold fast to God. What a human being knows by himself about love is very superficial; he must come to know the deeper love from God-that is, in self-denial he must become what every human being can become (since self-denial is related to the universally human and thus is distinguished from the particular call and election), an instrument for God. Thus every human being can come to know everything about love, just as every human being can come to know that he, like every human being, is loved by God. Some find this thought adequate for the longest life (which doesnâ€™t seem surprising to me); so even at the age of seventy they do not think that they have marveled over it enough, whereas others find this thought so insignificant (which seems to me very strange and deplorable), since to be loved by God is no more than every human being is-as if it were therefore less significant.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1410;That simple wise man of old, who knew how to talk so beautifully about the love that loves the beautiful, at times also conducted another kind of discourse, when he spoke about loving the ugly. He did not deny that to love is to love the beautiful, but he still spoke also aboutâ€”indeed it was a kind of jestâ€”loving the ugly. What then is meant by the beautiful? The beautiful is the immediate, and direct object of immediate love, the choice of inclination and of passion. Surely there is no need to command that one shall love the beautiful.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1411;"And what is the ugly? It is the neighbor, whom one shall love. One shall love him; that simple wise man knew nothing at all about this. He did not know that the neighbor existed and that one should love him; when he spoke about loving the ugly, it was only teasing. The neighbor is the unlovable object, is not anything to offer to inclination and passion, which turn away from him and say, â€œIs that anything to love!â€ But for that very reason there is no advantage connected with speaking about having to love the un-lovable object. Yet the true love is love for the neighbor, or it is not to find the lovable object but to find the un-lovable object lovable.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1412;Since the world does not really believe in God, in the long run the God-fearing person must really love himself. The God-fearing person does not love what the world loves, but then what is leftâ€”God and himself. The world takes God away, and therefore the God-fearing person loves himself. The world regards the fear of God as self-love.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1413;"Father in heaven! What one in society with men, especially there in the human swarm, with so much difficulty learns to know, and what, in case one has elsewhere learned to know it, is so easily forgotten in society with men, namely, what it is to be man, and what in a godly understanding of it is the requirement for being man-oh, that we might learn this, or, if it is forgotten, that we again might learn it from the lilies and the birds; that we might learn it, if not all at once and all in all, yet at least something of it, and little by little; that at this time we might from the lilies and the birds learn silence, obedience, joy!";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1414;the poet talks thus: â€˜Oh, would I were a bird, or would I were like a bird, like a free bird which gratifies its Wanderlust by flying far, far away over the sea and land, so near to heaven, unto distant climes â€“ ah poor me, who feel only too much bound to the spot, bound and nailed there , where I am the mark of daily cares and sufferings and adversities, compelled to dwell there, and for the whole duration of my life! Oh, would I were a bird, or would I were like a bird, which rises into the air lighter than the air itself, oh, would I were like the airy bird which when it lacks a footing can build its nest upon the surface of the sea â€“ while I, alas, with every slightest movement, even when I merely turn upon my bed, feel how gravity weighs me down!;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1415;"The surprising happened to him. In proportion as he became more and more earnest in prayer, he had less and less to say, and in the end he became quite silent. He became silent â€“ indeed, what is if possible still more expressly the opposite of speaking, he became a hearer. He had supposed that to pray is to speak; he learnt that to pray is not merely to be silent but to hear. And so it is; to pray is not to hear oneself speak, but it is to be silent, and to remain silent, to wait, until the man who prays hears God. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1416;"When suffering is neither more nor less, that is when it is merely that definite thing which it is, then, even though it were the greatest suffering, it is the least that it can be. But when it becomes indefinite however great the suffering really is, this indefiniteness increases the suffering endlessly. And this indefiniteness emerges precisely with manâ€™s ambiguous advantage of being able to talk. On the other hand, the definiteness of suffering, the experience that it is neither more nor less than it is, is attained only by being able to keep silent; and this silence thou canst learn from the birds and the lilies.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1417;"The most important thing with the Gospel is not to scold and rebuke, what is most important with the Gospel is to get men to follow it. Hence it says, â€˜Seek firstâ€™. Thereby it stops the mouth, so to speak, of all manâ€™s objections, brings him to silence, and gets him actually to begin with this seeking; and then this seeking so satisfies man that it becomes true that he seeks solely and only Godâ€™s kingdom.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1418;"We men, or a man in the situation of the lily, would surely say, â€˜It is hard, it is not to be endured , when one is a lily and beautiful as a lily, then to be allotted a place in such a situation, to bloom there in an environment which is as unfavorable as possible, as though expressly calculated to annihilate the impression of oneâ€™s beauty; no, that is not to be put up with, that is indeed a self-contradiction on the part of the Creator!â€™ So it is we men would likely think and talk, if we were in the situation of the lily, and thereupon we would wither with grief. But the lily thinks differently, it thinks thus: â€˜I myself have not been able to determine the situation and the circumstances, and so it is not in the remotest way my affair; that I stand where I stand is Godâ€™s will.â€™";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1419;"And then think of the innumerable multitudes of men now living! We men speak of its being a work of patience to be a school-teacher for little children; and then think God who must be the school-teacher for this innumerable multitude! What patience! And then what makes the tax upon patience infinitely greater is that where God is school-teacher all the children suffer more or less from the delusion that they are big grown-up men, a delusion from which the lilies and birds are quite free â€“ and surely just for this reason, that absolute obedience comes so easily to them. â€˜If on top of everything else,â€™ as human school-teacher might say, â€˜if on top of everything else the children got the notion that they were grown-up men, one must lose all patience and must despair; for that would be something no man could endure.â€™ No, surely no man could endure it, only the God of patience can.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1420;"What then does the Gospel do? The Gospel, which is the wisdom of child-training, does not enter into strife with man about thoughts and words, in order to prove to him that this is so; the Gospel knows full well that it is not thus the thing is accomplished, that it is not as though a man first understands that it is so as it is said to be, and thereupon resolves unconditionally to obey, but conversely, that by obeying unconditionally a man first comes to understand that it is so as the Gospel says.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1421;"What is joy? Or what is it to be joyful? It is to be present to oneself; but to be truly present to oneself is this thinking of â€˜todayâ€™, that is, this thing of being today, of truly being today. And in the same degree that it is more true that thou art today, in the same degree that thou art quite present to thyself in being today, in that very same degree is the baleful tomorrow non-existent for thee. Joy is the present tense, with the whole emphasis upon the present. Therefore it is that God is blessed, who eternally says, Today, and therefore it is that the lilies and the birds are joy, because with silence and unconditional obedience they are entirely present to themselves in being today.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1422;Learn therefore furthermore from the lilies and the birds: cast all thy care upon God, entirely, absolutely, as the lilies and the birds do â€“ then thou dost become absolutely joyful like the lilies and the birds. For this is the absolute joy, to adore the almighty power with which God the Almighty bears all thy care and sorrow as easily as nothing. And this also is the absolute joy, the next one, which in fact the Apostle subjoins, adoringly to dare to believe that â€˜God careth for thee.â€™;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1423;Consider what applies to thee, if not as a man, at least as a Christian, that even the danger of death is for thee so unimportant that it is said, â€˜Even now today art thou in Paradise,â€™ and thus the transition from time to eternity (the greatest possible transition) is so swift â€“ and though it were to occur in the midst of universal destruction, it is yet so swift that thou even now today are in Paradise, for the fact that thou dost Christianly remain in God. For if thou dost remain in God, then whether thou dost live or die, and whether thou diest today or only after seventy years, or whether thou findest death at the bottom of the sea where it is deepest, or thou art scattered in the air â€“ thou dost not find thyself outside of God, thou remainest, and so thou remainst present to thyself in God, and art therefore at the day of thy death even now in Paradise. P.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1424;"This sickness is not unto death (John 11:4), and yet Lazarus died; for when the disciples misunderstood the words which Christ adjoined later, ""Lazarus our friend is asleep, but I go to wake him out of his sleep"" (11:11), He said plainly, ""Lazarus is dead""";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1425;"It is because He exists; that is why this sickness is not unto death. For in human terms death is the last thing of all, and in human terms hope exists only so long as there is life; but to Christian eyes death is by no mean the last thing of all, just another minor event in that which is all, an eternal life.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1426;This then is the formula which describes the state of the self when despair is completely eradicated: in relating to itself and in wanting to be itself, the self is grounded transparently in the power that established it.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1427;Is despair an excellence or a defect? Regarded in a purely dialectical way it is both. ... If only the abstract idea of despair is considered, without any thought of someone in despair, it must be regarded as a surpassing excellence. The possibility of this sickness is man's superiority over the animal, and this superiority distinguishes him in quite another way than does his erect walk, for it indicates infinite erectness or sublimity, that he is spirit.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1428;"alternate quotation The possibility of this sickness is manâ€™s advantage over the beast; to be aware of this sickness is the Christianâ€™s advantage over natural man; to be cured of this sickness is the Christianâ€™s blessedness.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1429;"The self which, in his despair, he wants to be is a self he is not â€“ to want to be the self he truly is, is the opposite of despair; but he wants to tear his self away from the power that established it.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1430;"A despairing man is in despair over something. So it seems for an instant, but only for an instant; that same instant the true despair manifests itself, or despair manifests itself in its true character. For in the fact that he despaired of something, he really despaired of himself, and now would be rid of himself.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1431;"Thus when the ambitious man, whose slogan was ""Either Caesar or nothing"", does not become Caesar, he is in despair over it. But this signifies something else, namely, that precisely because he did not become Caesar he now cannot bear to be himself. Consequently he is not in despair over the fact that he did not become Caesar, but he is in despair over himself for the fact that he did not become Caesar.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1432;"Ah, so much is said about human want and misery â€” I seek to understand it, I have also had some acquaintance with it at close range; so much is said about wasted lives...";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1433;"Despair must be considered under the aspect of consciousness; it is whether or not despair is conscious that qualitatively distinguishes one form of despair from another. (â€¦) Consciousness is the decisive factor. The more consciousness the more will; the more will, the more self. Someone who has no will at all is no self. But the more will he has the more self consciousness he has too.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1434;"The greatest danger, that of losing one's own self, may pass off as quietly as if it were nothing; every other loss, that of an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife etc., is sure to be noticed.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1435;The determinist, the fatalist, is in despair and as one in despair has lost his self, because for him everything has become necessity.... The self of the determinist cannot breathe, for it is impossible to breathe necessity exclusively, because that would utterly suffocate a person's self.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1436;"Once he would gladly have given everything to be rid of this agony, but he was kept in waiting; now it is too late, now he would rather rage against everything and be the wronged victim of the whole world and of all life, and it is of particular significance to him to make sure that he has his torment on hand and that no one takes it away from him... What demonic madness â€” the thought that most infuriates him is that eternity could get the notion to deprive him of his misery.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1437;"This view will doubtless seem to many a paradox, an exaggeration, and a gloomy and depressing view at that. Yet it is nothing of the sort. It is not gloomy; on the contrary, it seeks to throw light upon a subject which ordinarily is left in obscurity. It is not depressing; on the contrary it is uplifting, since it views every man in the aspect of the highest demand made upon him, that he be spirit.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1438;Just as finitude is the confining factor in relation to infinitude, so necessity is the constraining factor in relation to possibility.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1439;The law for the development of the self in respect of understanding, so long as it remains true that the self is becoming itself, is that every increase in understanding corresponds to a greater degree of self-understanding, that the more it knows, the more it knows itself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1440;Eternity asks you and every individual in these millions and millions only one thing: whether you have lived in despair or not, whether you have despaired in such a way that you did not realize that you were in despair, or in such a way that you covertly carried this sickness inside of you as your gnawing secret... or in such a way that you, a terror to others, raged in despair.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1441;Sin is this: before God, or with the conception of God, to be in despair at not willing to be oneself, or in despair at willing to be oneself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1442;"It was a very just thought to which the older dogmatic frequently recurred, whereas a later dogmatic so often censored it for lack of understanding and a proper sense of its meaning â€” it was a very just thought, although sometimes a wrong application was made of it: the thought that what makes sin so frightful is that it is before God. From this the theologians proved the eternity of hell-punishment. Subsequently they became shrewder and said, ""Sin is sin; sin is not greater because it is against God or before God."" Strange! For even the jurists talk about ""qualified"" crimes and extenuating circumstances, even the jurists make distinction with regard to a crime, inquiring, for example, whether it is committed against a public functionary or a private person, they prescribe a different punishment for the murder of a father and an ordinary murder.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1443;"The sin/faith opposition is the Christian one which transforms all ethical concepts in a Christian way and distils one more decoction from them. At the root of the opposition lies the crucial Christian specification: before God; and that in turn has the crucial Christian characteristic: the absurd, the paradox, the possibility of offense. And it is of the utmost importance that this is demonstrated in every specification of the Christian, since offense is the Christian protection against all speculative philosophy. In what, then, do we find the possibility of offence here? In the fact that a person should have the reality of his being, as a particular human being, directly before God, and accordingly, again, by the same token, that manâ€™s sin should be of concern to God. This notion of the single human being before God never occurs to speculative thought; it only universalizes particular humans phantastically in the human race.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1444;The natural man, the pagan, thinks like this: â€˜Never mind, I admit I havenâ€™t understood everything in heaven and on earth. If there is to be a revelation let it teach us about heavenly things. But that there should be revelation to explain what sin is, thatâ€™s the most ridiculous thing Iâ€™ve heard. I donâ€™t pretend to be a perfect human being, far from it, but I know it, and I am willing to admit how far from perfect I am. You think I donâ€™t know what sin is? But Christianity replies: â€˜No, that is what you know least of all, how far from perfect you are and what sin is.â€ (â€¦) Sin is: having been taught by a revelation from God what sin is, before God in despair not to want to be oneself or in despair to want to be oneself.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1445;"Furthermore, specifying sin as affirmative involves the possibility of offence in a quite different sense, namely as the paradox. For the paradox results from the doctrine of the atonement. Christianity proceeds first to set up sin so firmly as an affirmative position that human understanding can never comprehend it; and then the same doctrine undertakes to remove this affirmative position in a way that human understanding can never comprehend.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1446;As long as there is a believer, this person, in order to have become that, must have been and as a believer must be just as contemporary with Christâ€™s presence as his contemporaries were. This contemporaneity is the condition of faith.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1447;Come here to me, all you who labor and are burdened. This he says, and those who lived with him saw and see that there truly is not the slightest thing in his way of life that contradicts it. With the silent and veracious eloquence of action, his life expresses-even if he had never said these words-his life expresses: Come here to me, all you who labor and are burdened. He stands by his word or he himself is his word: he is what he says-in this sense, too, he is the Word. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1448;"If you are conscious of yourself as a sinner, he will not question you about it; he will not break the bruised reed even more, but will raise you up when you accept him. He will not identify you by contrast, by placing you apart from himself so that your sin becomes even more terrible.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1449;"â€œHistory,â€ says faith, â€œhas nothing at all to do with Jesus Christ; with regard to him we have only sacred history (which is qualitatively different from history in general), which relates the story of abasement, also that he claimed to be God.â€";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1450;"The sagacious and sensible person might say, â€œof course he does not invite me anyway; for he invites only those who labor and are burdened.â€ â€¦. The philosopher might say, â€œit is madness for the single individual to want to be God. If this madness were possible, that an individual human being was God, then to be consistent one would have to worship this particular human being; a greater philosophical brutishness cannot be imagined.â€ The scoffer might say, â€œThe contradiction is solely and only and exclusively the inventorâ€™s: that a human being just like the rest of us, but not as well-dressed as the average person, therefore that a poorly dressed person who most likely belongs under the welfare department-that he is God.â€ ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1451;"It is cunning of the inviter to say: I heal all sicknesses, and then when one comes says: I acknowledge only that there is one sickness-sin-of that and from that I heal all of those â€œwho labor and are burdened,â€ all of those who labor to work themselves out of the power of sin, labor to resist evil, to overcome their weakness, but only manage to be burdened. Of this sickness he heals â€œallâ€; even if there were but one single person who turned to him on account of his sickness-he heals all. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1452;"And what does it all mean? It means that each individual in quiet inwardness before God is to humble himself under what it means in the strictest sense to be a Christian, is to confess honestly before God where he is so that he still might worthily accept the grace that is offered to every imperfect person-that is, to everyone. And then nothing further; then, as for the rest, let him do his work and rejoice in it, love his wife and rejoice in her, joyfully bring up his children, love his fellow beings, rejoice in life.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1453;Fear yourself, fear what can kill the faith and in that way kills Jesus Christ for you-the offense. Fear and tremble, for faith is carried in a fragile earthen vessel, in the possibility of offense.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1454;The God-man is not the union of God and man-such terminology is a profound optical illusion. The God-man is the unity of God and an individual human being.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1455;The generation wants to form the established order, to abolish God, in the fear of men to browbeat the single individual into a mousehole-but this God does not want, and he uses the very opposite tactic-he uses the single individual to prod the established order out of self-complacency. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1456;The possibility of offense in relation to Christ qua God-man will continue until the end of time. If the possibility of this offense is taken away, it will mean that Christ, too, is taken away, that he is made into something different from what he is, the sign of offense and the object of faith. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1457;One becomes a Christian only in the situation of contemporaneity with Christ, and in the situation of contemporaneity everyone will also become aware.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1458;If I voluntarily give up everything, choose danger and difficulties, then it is impossible to avoid spiritual trial (which in turn is a specifically Christian category but of course has been abolished in Christendom), which comes with the responsibility (which in turn corresponds to the voluntary), when it is said: Why do you want to expose yourself to this and begin such a thing-after all, you could leave it alone. This is specific Christian suffering: it is a whole scale deeper than the ordinary human sufferings.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1459;To commit a whole life to suffering, to sacrifice, is madness of the understanding. If I am to submit to a suffering, says the understanding, if I am to sacrifice something or in any way sacrifice myself, then I also want to be able to know what profit and advantage I can have from it-otherwise I would be a lunatic to do it. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1460;"The God-man (and, as said before, by that Christianity does not understand this fantastic speculation about the unity of God and man but an individual human being who is God) exists only for faith; but the possibility of offense is precisely the repulsion in which faith can come into existence-if one does not choose to be offended. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1461;"Wherever it is the case that the teacher is an essential component, there is a reduplication; â€¦ that the teacher is the integral; â€¦ where there is reduplication communication is not direct. Reduplication in the teacher through his existing in what he teaches; all direct communication is impossible. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1462;It was Christâ€™s free resolve from eternity to want to be incognito. He had superiority over himself in such a way that one seems lowlier than one is.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1463;The possibility of offense is present at every moment, confirming at every moment the chasmic abyss between the single individual and the God-man over which faith and faith alone reaches ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1464;Eighteen hundred years have not contributed a jot to demonstrating the truth of Christianity. In proportion as the demonstration increased in power-fewer and fewer were convinced.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1465;Lowliness, abasement, is the stumbling stone, the possibility of offense, and you are situated between his abasement, which lies behind, and his loftiness-that is precisely why he is said to draw to himself. The abasement belongs just as essentially to him as the loftiness.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1466;Lord, increase my faith. The person who prayed this prayer was not an unbeliever but a believer. The person who prays this prayer aright must already feel himself drawn. Be aware of His presence. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1467;Whether you or some person has adversities in life, whether things perhaps go downhill for him, or whether he perhaps loses his beloved: this is not called suffering like that of Jesus. Such sufferings are universally human, in which the pagans are tried as much as Christians.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1468;"This is the test: to become and continue to be a Christian, a suffering with which no other human suffering can be compared in pain and anguish. Yet neither Christianity nor Christ is cruel. No, Christ is himself leniency and love, is love and leniency itself; the cruelty comes from the Christianâ€™s having to live in this world and having to express in the environment of this world what it is to b e a Christian-for Christ is not so lenient, that is, so weak, that he wants to take the Christian out of this world.";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1469;When the truth is the way, being the truth is a life-and this is indeed how Christ speaks of himself: I am the Truth, the Way and the Life-the illusion of the Church triumphant is that Christianity has been regarded as truth in the sense of results instead of it being truth in the sense of the way.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1470;Only the Church militant is truth-the Church triumphant and established Christendom are an illusion. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1471;Lord Jesus Christ, you did not come to the world to be served and thus not to be admired either, or in that sense worshiped. You yourself were the Way and the Life-and you have asked only for imitators. If we have dozed off into this infatuation, wake us up, rescue us from this error of wanting to admire or adoringly admire you instead of wanting to follow you and be like you. ;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1472;"When it comes to the moral, to want to admire instead of imitate is not an invention by bad people-no, it is the spineless invention by those who must be called the better but also weak people, whereby they seek to keep themselves detached. They are related to the admired one only though the imagination; to them he is like a theatrical play. ";Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1473;When the truth is the way there are â€œthree ways to go wrong-to go the wrong way, to stumble on the way, to make a wrong turn away from the wayâ€-we pray to you that you will draw the strayer back to yourself, will strengthen the stumbler on the way, will lead back to the way those who have gone astray.;Søren Kierkegaard,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1474;The human race is a monotonous affair. Most people spend the greatest part of their time working in order to live, and what little freedom remains so fills them with fear that they seek out any and every means to be rid of it.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1510;They should be ashamed of themselves, all these sober people!;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1511;How many kings are governed by their ministers, how many ministers by their secretaries? Who, in such cases, is really the chief?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1512;"If you inquire what the people are like here, I must answer, ""The same as everywhere."" The human race is but a monotonous affair. Most of them labour the greater part of their time for mere subsistence";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1513;Is it not enough that we cannot make one another happy, must we also rob one another of the pleasures that any heart may permit itself now and then? And name me a person who in a bad mood will be decent enough to hide it, to bear it alone, without destroying the joy around him. Is it not rather an inner dissatisfaction with our own unworthiness, a dislike of ourselves that is always associated with envy aggravated by foolish conceit? We see people happy and not made happy by us, and that is unbearable.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1514;إننى وحيد تماما. وأجد الحياة ممتعة جدا فى هذه البقعة التى انشئت للأرواح المشابهة لروحى. إننى سعيد جدا ومستغرق فى الإحساس بالوجود الهادئ.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1515;متى تخلينا عن أنفسنا ضعنا ضياعا تاما!;يوهان جوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1516;The affairs of the world are no more than so much trickery, and a man who toils for money or honour or whatever else in deference to the wishes of others, rather than because his own desire or needs lead him to do so, will always be a fool.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1517;سوء الفهم والاهمال تنجم عنهما من المساوئ و الأضرار أكثر مما ينجم عادة عن سوء النية و الرغبة في الشر و الالتواء;جوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1519;An angel! Nonsense! Everybody so describes his mistress;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1520;That the life of man is but a dream, many a man has surmised heretofore;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1521;And I like those authors best whose scenes describe my own situation in life-- and the friends who are about me whose stories touch me with interest, from resembling my own homely existence.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1522;When a nation which has long groaned under the intolerable yoke of a tyrant rises at last and throws off its chains, do you call that weakness? The man who, to rescue his house from the flames, finds his physical strength redoubled, so that he lifts burdens with ease which in the absence of excitement he could scarcely move;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1523;Say what you will of fortitude, but show me the man who can patiently endure the laughter of fools when they have obtained an advantage over him. 'Tis only when their nonsense is without foundation that one can suffer it without complaint.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1524;I thank you, Wilhelm, for your heartfelt sympathy, for your well-intentioned advice, but beg you to be quiet. Let me stick it out. Blessedly exhausted as I am, I have strength enough to carry through. I honor religion, you know that, I feel it is a staff for many weary souls, refreshment for many a one who is pining away. But--can it be, must it be, the same thing for everyone? If you look at the great world, you see thousands for whom it wasn't, thousands for whom it will not be the same, preached or unpreached, and must it then be the same for me? Does not the son of God Himself say that those would be around Him whom the Father had given Him? But if I am not given? If the Father wants to keep me for Himself, as my heart tells me?--I beg you, do not misinterpret this, do not see mockery in these innocent words. What I am laying before you is my whole soul;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1525;البشر بشر يا صديقي، وبالغا ما بلغ مدى قدرته على التفكير والتعقل فهذه القدرة لا تجديه فتيلا عندما تعصف به الأهواء والعواطف ويلفى نفسه محصورا في حدود الطبيعة الضيقة.;يوهان جوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1526;My days are as happy as those reserved by God for his elect;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1527;The world runs on from one folly to another;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1528;I was on the point of breaking off the conversation, for nothing puts me so completely out of patience as the utterance of a wretched commonplace when I am talking from my inmost heart.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1529;Misunderstandings and neglect occasion more mischief in the world than even malice and wickedness.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1530;Mußte denn das so sein, daß das, was des Menschen Glückseligkeit macht,wieder die Quelle seines Elendes würde?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1531;Does not man lack the force at the very point where he needs it most? And when he soars upward in joy, or sinks down in suffering, is not checked in both, is he not returned again to the dull, cold sphere of awareness, just when he was longing to lose himself in the fullness of the infinite.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1532;Would you require a wretched being, whose life is slowly wasting under a lingering disease, to despatch himself at once by the stroke of a dagger? Does not the very disorder which consumes his strength deprive him of the courage to effect his deliverance?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1533;أنت مطلع يا إلهى على عذابى، فاجعل له نهاية!;يوهان فولفغانغ فون غوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1534;Woe to him who could look on and say: The fool! If she had waited, if she had let time do its work, her despair would surely have subsided, another man would have turned up to comfort her.— That's just like saying: The fool, dying of fever! If he had waited until his strength returned, his circulation improved, the tumult of his blood calmed down, everything would have turned out well and he would still be alive today!;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1535;Happy is it, indeed, for me that my heart is capable of feeling the same simple and innocent pleasure as the peasant whose table is covered with food of his own rearing, and who not only enjoys his meal, but remembers with delight the happy days and sunny mornings when he planted it, the soft evenings when he watered it, and the pleasure he experienced in watching its daily growth.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1536;I mean now to try and see her as soon as I can: or perhaps, on second thoughts, I had better not;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1537;God knows I often retire to my bed wishing (at times even hoping) that I might never wake up;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1538;لكم يسرنى أن أراك ثانية، فأنا أحبك فوق كل شئ.;يوهان فولفغانغ فون غوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1539;To what a world does the illustrious bard carry me! To wander over pathless wilds, surrounded by impetuous whirlwinds, where, by the feeble light of the moon, we see the spirits of our ancestors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1540;ما أندر ما ييفهم البشر بعضهم بعضا في هذا العالم!;يوهان جوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1541;I wish someone would dare reproach me about the whole thing so that I could run a dagger through his heart. If only I could see blood. I know I would feel better. Oh, I have picked up a knife a hundred times with the intention of plunging it into my own heart! I have heard tell of a noble breed of stallions who when they are overheated and run wild, instinctively bite open one of their veins to relieve themselves. I feel like that often. I would like to open the vein that would give me eternal freedom.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1542;Aber ich habe sie gehabt, ich habe das Herz gefühlt, die große Seele, in deren Gegenwart ich mir schien mehr zu sein, als ich war, weil ich alles war, was ich sein konnte.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1543;أننا ميالون للشكوى و التذمر ز إن أيام سعادتنا قليلة و أيام تعاستنا كثيرة, فلو أن قلوبنا كانت متأهبة باستمرار لتلقي النعم التي تنعطف بها السماء علينا لتسنى لنا أن نكتسب القوة الكفيلة بتحمل الشرور و البلايا عندما يأتي أوانها;جوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1544;Indeed, I am nothing but a wanderer and a pilgrim on this earth! And what more are you?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1545;Gracious Providence, to whom I owe all my powers, why didst thou not withhold some of those blessings I possess, and substitute in their place a feeling of self-confidence and contentment?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1548;one must submit, like a traveller who has to ascend a mountain: if the mountain was not there, the road would be both shorter and pleasanter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1549;When any distress or terror surprises us in the midst of our amusements, it naturally makes a deeper impression than at other times, either because the contrast makes us more keenly susceptible, or rather perhaps because our senses are then more open to impressions, and the shock is consequently stronger.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1550;For we are so constituted by nature, that we are ever prone to compare ourselves with others;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1551;ما الدنيا لدى أفئدتنا بدون الحب؟;يوهان جوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1552;I could be living the best and happiest of lives if only I were not a fool.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1553;So much simplicity with so much understanding — so mild, and yet so resolute — a mind so placid, and a life so active.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1554;يُطاردنى إحساس بأن حياة المرء إن هى إلا حلم.;يوهان فولفغانغ فون غوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1555;Shame upon him who can look on calmly, and exclaim,‘The foolish girl! she should have waited;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1557;Weary of liberty, he suffered himself to be saddled and bridled, and was ridden to death for his pains.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1558;We so frequently feel that we are lacking in many qualities which another person apparently possesses;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1559;I am contented, happy, and consequently a bad historian.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1560;Naturalists tell of a noble race of horses that instinctively open a vein with their teeth, when heated and exhausted by a long course, in order to breathe more freely. I am often tempted to open a vein, to procure for myself everlasting liberty. Cento volte ho impugnato una lama per conficcarmela nel cuore. Si dice di una nobile razza i cavalli,che quando si sentono accaldati e affaticati, si aprono istintivamente una vena, per respirare più liberamente. Spesso anche io vorrei aprirmi una vena che mi desse libertà eterna.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1561;There is not a moment but preys upon you,—and upon all around you, not a moment in which you do not yourself become a destroyer. The most innocent walk deprives of life thousands of poor insects: one step destroys the fabric of the industrious ant, and converts a little world into chaos. No: it is not the great and rare calamities of the world, the floods which sweep away whole villages, the earthquakes which swallow up our towns, that affect me. My heart is wasted by the thought of that destructive power which lies concealed in every part of universal nature. Nature has formed nothing that does not consume itself, and every object near it: so that, surrounded by earth and air, and all the active powers, I wander on my way with aching heart;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Quando vemos algumas pessoas felizes, sem que para isso tenhamos contribuído, essa felicidade nos é insuportável.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1569;"و لكن وا أسفاه! عندما نبلغ مقصودنا ويتحول ما كان بعيداً""هناك""إلى ما هو حاضرٌ ""هنا"" اذا بكل شئ و قد تغير, واذا بنا على ما كنا فيه من فاقة و صيق , و اذا أرواحنا لهفانة متعطشة لم تزل إلى السعادة التي لا تنال";جوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1571;What I have lately said of painting is equally true with respect to poetry. It is only necessary for us to know what is really excellent, and venture to give it expression;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1572;أجدني الآن إذا أطللت من النافذة، فرأيت عروس الصبح تخترق أشعتها حُجب الضباب فوق الهضاب البعيدة، وتُضيء مروج الوادي الخالية الصامتة، وأبصرت النهر الهادي يسعى إلىّ مُنسابًا بين أشجار الصفصاف العارية انسياب الأفعوان، أقف وقفة المتعجب المرتاب أسائل نفسي: لم أصبحت هذه الطبيعة الجميلة أمامي باردة خامدة كأنها صورة مطبوعة ملونة؟ وكيف لا يستطيع كل ما أرى من جمالٍ وسحرٍ أن يحمل القلب على أن يرسل إلى المخ قطرةً واحدةً من الهناء والغبطة.لقد بلغ بي ذلك أن أقف أمام الخالق كأنني الوعاء الفارغ والينبوع الناضب! ولطالما خررت ساجدًا أجأر بالدعاء إليه أن يجود عيني بالمطر، كما يستقي الفلاح الغمام إذا رأى السماء قد أماطت عن وجهها قناع الحياء، ووجد الأرض قد أجهدها العطش وأعوزها الماء.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1577;Show me the man who has the courage to hide his ill-humour, who bears the whole burden himself, without disturbing the peace of those around him. No: ill-humour arises from an inward consciousness of our own want of merit, from a discontent which ever accompanies that envy which foolish vanity engenders. We see people happy, whom we have not made so, and cannot endure the sight.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1578;"If you ask what the people here are like, I must tell you, ""Like people everywhere!"" Uniformity marks the human race.";Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1584;I'll see the sprouts in the morning when you wake up from sleep, and with glee look at the way the bright sun, I'll see it...And then I have no more desire for others the whole day. Everything, everything is covered with these expectations.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1585;In this world one is seldom reduced to make a selection between two alternatives. There are as many varieties of conduct and opinion as there are turns of feature between an aquiline nose and a flat one.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1586;Father! Whom I do not know! Father! who filled all my soul and who has now turned His countenance away from me! Call me to You! Be silent no longer! Your silence will not stay this thirsting soul—and could a person, a father, be angry whose son, unexpectedly returning, threw himself on his neck and cried: Father! I have come back! Don’t be angry that I am breaking off the travels that you meant for me to endure longer. The world is everywhere the same, in effort and work, reward and joy, but what is that to me? I am only happy where you are, and it is before your countenance that I want to suffer and enjoy.—And You, dear heavenly Father, would turn him away from You?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1594;My grandmother used to tell us a story of a mountain of loadstone. When any vessels came near it, they were instantly deprived of their ironwork: the nails flew to the mountain, and the unhappy crew perished amidst the disjointed planks.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1595;واأسفاه! إن الإنسان لسريع الزوال: يُمحى ويزول حتى من المكان الوحيد الذي يتأكد فيه وجوده وتثمر فيه عواطفه وعهوده: يزول من ذاكرة أحبابه وقلوب أعزائه، وذلك - واحسرتاه - يحدث في أسرع ما يكون.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1600;¿Por qué será que lo que colma de felicidad al hombre es al mismo tiempo la fuente de sus desgracias?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1601;Che la vita di un uomo sia soltanto un sogno è già stato affermato da molti, e tale sentimento si è impadronito anche di me. Quando considero i limiti entro cui sono prigioniere le forze attive e speculative dell'uomo, quando vedo che ogni attività mira all'unico scopo di soddisfare i bisogni, i quali, a loro volta, servono soltanto a prolungare la misera esistenza, e poi comprendo che l'appagamento su certi punti delle nostre speculazioni non è altro che sognante rassegnazione perché dipingiamo soltanto variopinte figure e luminosi panorami sulle pareti fra le quali siamo prigionieri, tutto ciò, Guglielmo, mi ammutolisce. Rientro in me stesso e trovo un universo! Ma formato più di presentimenti e di oscuri desideri che di immagini e di forze viventi. Allora tutto si confonde davanti ai miei sensi, e io sorrido e continuo a sognare nel mondo.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1602;When I go out by the gateway, taking the road I drove along that first time I picked up Lotte for the ball, how very different it all is! It is all over, all of it! There is not a hint of the world that once was, not one bulse-beat of those past emotions. I feel like a ghost returning to the burnt-out ruins of the castle he built in his prime as a prince, which he adorned with magnificent splendours and then, on his deathbed, but full of hope, left to his beloved son;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1603;Her şeyi kendimizle, kendimizi de herkesle karşılaştıracak şekilde yaratılmışız bir kere, bundan dolayı mutluluk ve hüznümüz bağlı olduğumuz şeylerden etkileniyor kuşkusuz, bu durumda en tehlikeli şey de yalnızlık. Doğası gereği kendini aşmaya zorlanan, edebiyatın fantastik imgeleriyle beslenen hayal gücümüz, kendimizin en aşağıda bulunduğu bir dizi varlığı sıraya sokuyor, dışımızdaki her şey daha güzel, bizden başka herkes daha mükemmelmiş gibi görünüyor. Ve bu çok doğal bir akış içinde gerçekleşiyor. Bazı şeylerin bizde eksik olduğunu çok sık duyumsuyoruz, eksikliğini duyduğumuz şey de çoğunlukla bir başkasında varmış gibi geliyor bize, sahip olduklarımızın yanı sıra yüceltilen bir parça gönül huzurunu bile ona layık görüyoruz. Böylece şanslı kişinin, yani bizim hayal ürünümüz olan kişinin hiçbir eksiği kalmıyor. Oysa bütün zafiyetlerimiz ve dertlerimizle yolumuzdan sapmadan çalışmaya devam etsek, başkalarının yelkenleri ve kürekleriyle ilerlediği yolda biz dolaşıp zikzaklar çizdiğimiz halde öne geçtiğimizi sıklıkla göreceğiz-ve-elbette insan bunu ancak başkalarıyla aynı konuma gelince veya onların önüne geçince anlayabiliyor.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1608;Wir Menschen beklagen uns oft, dass der guten Tage so wenig sind und der schlimmen so viel - meist mit Unrecht.

1725;No obstante, si tú te alejases de su lado, sentirían... ¿cuánto tiempo sentirían el vacío que tu pérdida dejaría en sus existencias?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1726;I have made all sorts of acquaintances, but have as yet found no society. I know not what attraction I possess for the people, so many of them like me, and attach themselves to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1727;Tanrı'ya, onu bana bağışlaması için dua edemiyorum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1728;Sólo Dios sabe cuánto me cuesta mirar y remirar tantos encantos, sin atreverme a extender mis manos hacia ella. Apoderarse de lo que se ofrece a nuestra vista y nos embelesa, ¿no es un instinto propio de la humanidad? ¿No se esfuerza el niño por coger cuanto le gusta? Y yo..?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1729;Sólo Dios sabe cuántas veces me he dormido con el deseo y la esperanza de no despertar jamás. Y al día siguiente abro los ojos, vuelvo a ver la luz del sol y siento de nuevo el peso de mi existencia.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1730;Este corazón está ahora muerto, cerrado a todas las sensaciones;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1731;ill-humour resembles indolence: it isnatural to us;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1732;¡Pensar!—exclamé. ¿Qué necesidad tenéis derecordármelo, puesto que, piense o no piense, siempre estáis presente en mi alma?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1733;But when, in spite of weakness and disappointments, we set to work in earnest, and persevere steadily, we often find, that, though obliged continually to tack, we make more way than others who have the assistance of wind and tide;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1734;¿Por qué no he de confesar mi angustia en este momento en que mi ser tiembla y fluctúa entre la vida y la muerte, en que el pasado se proyecta como un relámpago en el sombrío abismo del porvenir, en que todo lo que me rodea se desploma y en que el mundo parece acabarse conmigo? ¿No reconoces la voz de la criatura extenuada, desfallecida, que se hunde sin remedio, y a pesar de su inútil lucha, gritando con amargura...;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1735;Suelo decirme a mí mismo: Tu destino no tiene igual: comparados contigo, los demás hombres son felices;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1739;Ho tante cose in me, e ciò che sento per lei divora tutto;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1740;Astfel se deschide mugurul iubirii în întreaga sa frumusețe și modestie. Mi se părea că o primăvară întreagă și-ar fi scuturat deodată florile peste mine.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1741;Pero la he tenido, he sentido su corazón, su alma grande, en cuya presencia me parecía ser más de lo que yo era, porque era todo lo que podía ser. ¡Dios mío! ¿Había entonces una sola energía en mi alma que quedara sin utilizar?¿No podía desplegar ante ella todo el admirable sentir con que rodea a mi corazón la Naturaleza?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1746;El que por complacer a los demás, contra su gusto y sin necesidad, se fatiga corriendo tras la fortuna, los honores u otra cosa cualquiera, es siempre un loco.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1747;The human race is a monotonous affair. Most people spend the greatest part of their time working in order to live, and what little freedom remains so fills them with fear that they seek out any and every means to be rid of it. What a thing our human destiny is!;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1748;¡Un ángel! ¡Bah! Todos dicen lo mismo de la que aman,¿no es verdad? Y, sin embargo, yo no podré decirte cuánperfecta es y por qué es perfecta;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1753;ما مصير الإنسان وما قدره, اللهم إلا أن يملأ كأس عذاباته ومعاناته, وأن يتجرع ما قدر له من المرارة؟ وإذا كانت هذه الكأس نفسها قد بدت مريرة للمسيح وهو في صورة البشر, فلماذا أتكلف كبرياء حمقاء وأنعت هذه الكأس بالعذوبة؟ لماذا ينبغي أن أخزى بالتراجع عند اللحظة الرهيبة عندما ترتجف روحي بين الوجود والعدم, وعندما تضيء ذكرى الماضي كوميض البرق, هاوية المستقبل المظلمة, فإذا بكل شيء ينحل حولي, وإذا العالم كله يتلاشى, أليس هذا هو صوت مخلوق تجاوز ضيقه وعناؤه كل حد, وخذلته ذاته, حتى بات على وشك الوثوب ليغوض في لجة الفناء الذي لا مناص منه, وهو ينادي متأوهًا من أعماقه ومتحسرًا على قوته المتداعية:إلهي, إلهي, لماذا تركتني؟;جوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1754;"İnsanın doğası sınırlıdır,"" diye devam ettim. ""Sevince, kedere, acılara ancak belli bir dereceye dek dayanabilir ve o derece aşılırsa, insan yok olur.

1758;Non, je ne me trompe pas ! je lis dans ses yeux noirs le sincère intérêtqu'elle prend à moi et à mon sort. Oui, je sens, et là-dessus je puis m'enrapporter à mon coeur, je sens qu'elle… Oh ! l'oserai-je ? oserai-je prononcerce mot qui vaut le ciel ?… Elle m'aime !Elle m'aime ! combien je me deviens cher à moi-même ! combien…j'ose te le dire à toi, tu m'entendras… combien je m'adore depuis qu'ellem'aime !;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1759;These children, who are our equals, whom we ought to consider as our models, we treat them as though they were our subjects. They are allowed no will of their own. And have we, then, none ourselves? Whence comes our exclusive right? Is it because we are older and more experienced? Great God! from the height of thy heaven thou beholdest great children and little children, and no others;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1760;Alas that the friend of my youth* has gone—alas that I ever knew her. I might say to myself, you are a fool, you are searching for something which is not to be found on earth. But I found her, I felt the heart and the generous soul of her in whose presence I felt myself to be more than I was because I was everything I could be.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1761;O, het is met de verte als met de toekomst! Een wijd, schemerachtig vergezicht ligt voor ons, onze ziel en onze ogen drinken het in, en wij haken ernaar ons er helemaal aan over te geven, om in alle gelukzaligheid van één groot, heerlijk gevoel te zijn vervuld. Maar och, als we erop afvliegen, dan is alles zoals tevoren en staan wij in onze armoede, in onze beperktheid, en onze ziel dorst naar ontglipte lafenis.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1762;...ta ki tanınmadık bir duygu onu karşı konulmazcasına başka bir insana sürükleyene dek;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1763;Mio caro, in questa banale faccenda ho nuovamente verificato che a questo mondo l'incomprensione e la pigrizia causano più errori dell'astuzia e della malvagità. O perlomeno, queste ultime sono di certo più rare.;Johann Wolfgang Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1764;Recibimos con docilidad toda primera impresión, porque el hombre está hecho de tal modo, que llega a persuadirse de que son verdad las cosas más absurdas, pero desde luego se graban en él tan profundamente, que infeliz del que pretenda destruirlas o borrarlas.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1765;You were happy! I exclaimed, as I returned quickly to the town, ‘as gay and contented as a man can be!’ God of heaven! and is this the destiny of man? Is he only happy before he has acquired his reason, or after he has lost it? Unfortunate being! And yet I envy your fate: I envy the delusion to which you are a victim. You go forth with joy to gather flowers for your princess — in winter — and grieve when you can find none, and cannot understand why they do not grow. But I wander forth without joy, without hope, without design;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1766;Ich lebe so glückliche Tage, wie sie Gott seinen Heiligen aufspart;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1767;إن من الأفعال ما هو إجرامى، أيا كانت البواعث التى تنبثق منها هذه الأفعال.;يوهان فولفغانغ فون غوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1768;Und ich habe wieder bei diesem kleinen Geschäft gefunden, daß Mißverständnisse und Trägheit vielleicht mehr Irrungen in der Welt machen als List und Bosheit. Wenigstens sind die beiden letzteren gewiß seltener.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1769;Los hombres, como los niños, caminando a tientas sobre la tierra, ignorando de dónde vienen y adónde van, son poco menos que autómatas y, exactamente como los niños, se dejan gobernar con juguetes, confites y azotes.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1770;Il malumore e la pigrizia sono in tutto simili, perché il malumore è una specie di pigrizia. A questa siamo portati per natura, e tuttavia se troviamo la forza per reagire ecco che il lavoro diviene agevole e l'attività un vero piacere.;Johann Wolfgang Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1771;ما الدنيا لدى أفئدتنا بدون الحب؟ ما الفانوس السحرى بدون الضوء؟ ما عليك إلا أن تضئ الشعلة بداخله حتى تشرق على الجدار الأبيض أيهى الصور والأشكال. ولئن كان الحب يرينا ظلالا عابرة فحسب، إلا أننا نشعر مع هذا بالسعادة عندما نراها - كالأطفال الصغار - فتخف بنا الأشباح البديعة وتطير بنا كل مطار.;يوهان فولفغانغ فون غوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1772;My friends esteem me;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1773;Daß das Leben des Menschen nur ein Traum sei, ist manchem schon so vorgekommen, und auch mit mir zieht dieses Gefühl immer herum. Wenn ich die Einschränkung ansehe, in welcher die tätigen und forschenden Kräfte des Menschen eingesperrt sind;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1774;When, in the morning at sunrise, I go out to Walheim, and with my own hands gather in the garden the peas which are to serve for my dinner, when I sit down to shell them, and read my Homer during the intervals, and then, selecting a saucepan from the kitchen, fetch my own butter, put my mess on the fire, cover it up, and sit down to stir it as occasion requires, I figure to myself the illustrious suitors of Penelope, killing, dressing, and preparing their own oxen and swine. Nothing fills me with a more pure and genuine sense of happiness than those traits of patriarchal life which, thank Heaven! I can imitate without affectation. Happy is it, indeed, for me that my heart is capable of feeling the same simple and innocent pleasure as the peasant whose table is covered with food of his own rearing, and who not only enjoys his meal, but remembers with delight the happy days and sunny mornings when he planted it, the soft evenings when he watered it, and the pleasure he experienced in watching its daily growth.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1775;Human beings are much of a muchness. Most spend th greater part of their time working in order to live, and what bit of freedom they are left with makes them so anxious they strive by all available means to be rid of it.;Goethe Johann Wolfgang von,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1776;Wir sollen es mit den Kindern machen wie Gott mit uns, der uns am glücklichsten macht, wenn er uns in freundlichem Wahne so hintaumeln läßt.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1777;Trato a este pobre corazón como a un niño enfermo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1778;All our learned schoolmasters and tutors are agreed that children do not know why they want what they want. But no one likes to think - blindingly obvious though it is, in my view - that grown-ups too, like children, totter around on the earth and, like the children, do not know where they have come from or where they are going, act no more than children do for any true purpose and are just as governed by biscuits, cakes, and the rod.;Goethe Johann Wolfgang von,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1779;It is natural that if some fright or calamity surprises us when we are enjoying ourselves it will affect us more strongly than usual, in part because of the contrast thus made very palpable, and in part, and perhaps more, because our senses have been opened to feeling and so take in impressions much faster.;Goethe Johann Wolfgang von,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1780;عمرك الله ما الإنسان وما قيمة تألُّهه وصلفه؟ أما تخذله قواه وتخونه عند مسّ الحاجة إليها، وضرورة الاعتماد عليها؟ أما يشعر عندما يُغرقه السرور أو يحرقه الحزن أنه موقوفٌ عند حدوده، ومردودٌ إلى إحساسه البارد بكونه ووجوده، على حين يرجو أن يسبح ويفنى في محيط اللانهاية بكبرٍ وصلفٍ؟;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1781;...nothing is more dangerous than solitude: there our imagination, always disposed to rise, taking a new flight on the wings of fancy, pictures to us a chain of beings of whom we seem the most inferior. All things appear greater than they really are, and all seem superior to us. This operation of the mind is quite natural: we so continually feel our own imperfections, and fancy we perceive in others the qualities we do not possess, attributing to them also all that we enjoy ourselves, that by this process we form the idea of a perfect, happy man,—a man, however, who only exists in our own imagination.;Goethe Johann Wolfgang Von,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1782;in pretending to be brave, to stiffen the others’ courage, I found my own courage.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1783;So the most restless wanderer longs in the end for his homeland again and finds in his cottage, in the arms of his wife, in the midst of his children, in the work of looking after them, the joy he had sought in vain in the wide world.;Goethe Johann Wolfgang von,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1784;Tengo tanto para dar y mis sentimientos hacia lo consumen todo, tengo tanto, tanto, y sin ella todo se convierte en nada.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1785;I came across my diary again today, which for some time I have neglected, and I'm astonished how consciously, step by step, I walked into it all. How clearly I have always seen my condition and acted like a child nevertheless, and how clearly I still see now, and still with no sign of a cure.;Goethe Johann Wolfgang von,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1786;for I have learned, by my own experience, that all extraordinary men, who have accomplished great and astonishing actions, have ever been decried by the world as drunken or insane.;Johann Wolfgange Von Gothe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1787;Ich gestehe dir gern, dass diejenigen die Glücklichsten sind, die gleich den Kindern in den Tag hineinleben.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1795;How difficult it is to understand one another in this world.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1796;The full and ardent sentiment which animated my heart with the love of nature, overwhelming me with a torrent of delight, and which brought all paradise before me, has now become an insupportable torment, a demon which perpetually pursues and harasses me.;Johann Wolfgange Von Gothe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1802;Ey ulu tanrım! Önce akıl sahibi olup sonra onu kaybetmedikçe mesut olmamak insanların alın yazısı mı?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1803;Çocuklar ne istediklerini bilmezler. Bütün eğitimciler bu konuda aynı düşüncede. Ama yetişkinler de bu dünyada çocuklar gibi sendeleye sendeleye dolaşır, Onlar gibi nereden gelip nereye gittiklerini bilmezler. Gerçek ülkülere doğru koşmaz, bisküviler ve çöreklerle avunurlar. Kimse buna inanmak istemez ama bence bunun kadar açık bir şey yoktur.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1804;آه يا وليم ما كان أسرّني وأبهجني لو خرجتُ عن طبيعتي البشرية فأقتحم الجو مع العواصف، وأخترق السحب وأثير الأمواج! ليت شِعري أما تكون هذه اللذائذ من نصيبنا أيها المسجونون يومًا ما؟;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1809;İnsanların birbirleri için pek az şey ifade etmesi bende genellikle göğsümü parçalamak, beynimi dağıtmak isteği uyandırıyor.

1816;Molto spesso sentiamo che ci manca qualcosa e proprio ciò che ci manca ci sembra di ritrovarlo in un altro, al quale attribuiamo non solo tutto quello che abbiamo, ma anche una certa ideale felicità. E cosi, questo essere beato, che noi stessi abbiamo creato, è completo e perfetto.Se noi invece, pur con le nostre debolezze e le nostre miserie, pensiamo solo a continuare il nostro lavoro, ci accogiamo subito che con il nostro passo tardo e lento arriviamo più lontano degli altri con tutti i loro remi e il loro vento in poppa - e allora, se restiamo alla pari con gli altri o addirittura passiamo loro davanti, finiamo con l'avere per noi un certo rispetto.;Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1835;When Odysseus speaks of the measureless sea and the boundless earth, it is all so true and human, so inwardly and closely felt, and so mysterious.

1852;Specia umana se poarta pretutindeni la fel. Majoritatea oamenilor isi intrebuinteaza cea mai mare parte din timp ca sa traiasca si putina libertate care le mai ramane ii inspaimanta atat de tare, incat fac tot ce le sta in putinta ca sa scape de dansa. O, destin al omului!;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1853;Nicht die große, seltne Not der Welt, diese Fluten, die eure Dörfer wegspülen, diese Erdbeben, die eure Städte verschlingen, rühren mich;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1854;Des Abends nehme ich mir vor, den Sonnenaufgang zu genießen, und komme nicht aus dem Bette;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1855;...m-am gandit mult la nazuinta omului de a se intinde, de a face noi descoperiri, de a rataci incoace si incolo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1856;Ah, o que eu sei, toda a gente o pode saber! Mas o meu coração só a mim pertence…;Johann Wolfgang Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1857;Zarea e ca si viitorul! In fata sufletului nostru sta un tot urias si nelamurit in care simtirea noastra se pierde ca si privirea, iar noi dorim plini de ardoare sa ne lasam cuprinsi cu voluptate de un unic, mare si splendid sentiment. Si cand alergam intr-acolo, cand acolo devine aici, totul e la fel ca mai inainte si ne simtim saraci si marginiti, si sufletul nostru tanjeste dupa mangaierea care a pierit.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1858;If that which harms oneself as well as one's neighbor deserves the name [of vice]. Is it not enough that we cannot make each otjer happy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1859;eu acho tão espantoso que se chame de covarde ou de desgraçado àquele que se priva da vida, como acharia impertinente chamar de covarde ao que sucumbe a uma febre maligna.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1860;I have made all manner of acquaintance but have yet to meet with any society. I do not know what it is that attracts people to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1861;and because it is characteristic of our mind to project confusion and darkness where we have nothing but uncertainty.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1862;That the life of Man is but a dream has been sensed by many a one, and I too am never free of the feeling. When I consider the restrictions that are placed on the active, inquiring energies of Man;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1863;It has been my fate to sadden those I owe joy.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1864;Hás de convir comigo que qualificamos de doença mortal a todas aquelas que atacam com tanta violência as forças da Natureza a ponto de ou consumir as energias dessa mesma Natureza ou pô-la fora de ação, de maneira que uma revolução salutar já não possa mais restabelecer o curso ordinário da vida. Pois bem, meu caro, apliquemos isso ao espírito. Olha para o homem em sua limitação e vê como as impressões atuam nele, como as idéias se fixam nele, até que enfim a paixão sempre crescente o priva de toda a força de vontade e o lança ao solo.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1865;I cannot quite warm to your suggestion that I accompany the ambassador to ––. I am no great friend of subordination;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1866;please practice moderation. Your mind, your knowledge, your talents offer you resources to happiness! Be a man, and conquer this tragic devotion from a creature who can do nothing but pity you.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1867;We arrived here yesterday . The ambassador is indisposed and will therefore be staying indoors for a few days. If only he were not so morose, all would be well. I can see all too clearly Fate has severe trials in store for me. But courage! A lighthearted spirit can put up with anything. A light heart? It makes me laugh, the way the words flow from my pen: oh, if there were a little more lightheartedness in my veins I should be the happiest creature under the sun. Am I to despair of my own powers, my own gifts, when others with paltry abilities and talents go showing off, smugly self-satisfied? Dear God who bestowed all these gifts on me, why didst Thou not keep half back, and in their place grant me confidence and contentment? Patience! Patience! All will improve. And I tell you, my dear fellow, you were right. I feel far better within myself now that I am among these people, kept busy day in, day out, watching their doings and goings-on. It is true that, since we are so constituted as to be forever comparing ourselves with others and our surroundings with ourselves, our happiness or misery depends on the things in our environment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1868;Em vão o homem ajuizado e razoável contemplará o estado do infeliz, em vão lhe dará seus conselhos! Da mesma forma que um homem saudável, parado junto ao leito do enfermo, jamais poderá transmitir-lhe a parte mais insignificante de suas energias.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1869;… I respect the way he rebukes my hypersensitivity, and pays tribute to my excessive notions of diligence, influence on others and perseverance in business affairs, which he describes as the plucky ambition of youth, saying he does not wish to destroy it but merely to moderate it and divert it into areas where it can be put to proper use and produce its rightful powerful effect. So now I have the strength for another week, and have regained my inner composure. Tranquillity of the soul is wonderful, as is joyful peace of mind. If only, dear friend, these precious treasures, beautiful and priceless as they are, were not so fragile too.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1870;I could often tear my heart open and beat my poor head on seeing how little people can mean to each other. If I do not offer love and joy, happiness and warmth, ah! the other will not bring them to me either;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1871;Children don’t know why they want what they want, teachers and judges are unanimous. But that adults, just like children, tumble about in the world without knowing where they come from and where they’re going – that they act in accordance with their avowed aims as little as children do – that they can be ruled by cookies and cakes and lashes just as easily as children – this no one wants to believe, though it seems to me so palpably true.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1872;Sentimos tantas vezes que nos faltam algumas coisas, e por vezes nos parece que o que nos falta um outro possui. ... E assim imaginamos nós mesmos as perfeições que criam o nosso suplício.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1873;It is the greatest and most genuine of pleasures to observe a great mind in sympathy with our own.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1874;İnsan aslında karmaşık bir varlık değil. Çoğunluğu zamanın büyük bir bölümünü yaşamak için kullanıyor, geriye kalanı sie, özgür oldukları küçük zaman diliminden öyle korkuyor ki, ondan kurtulmanın her türlü yolunu deniyor. İşte insanın değişmez yazgısı!;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1875;Şu sıralar resim yapmam mümkün değil, bir çizgi bile çizemiyorum, oysa ben hiç şu andakinden daha büyük bir ressam olmadım.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1876;..keşke insanlar -niçin böyle olduklarını ancak Tanrı bilir!- geçip giden şimdiyi yaşamak yerine, geçmişte kalan bir sıkıntının hatıralarını anımsamak için hayal gücünü bu kadar zorlamasalar.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1877;um pai, poderia irritar-se ao ver o filho que volta inesperadamente e se joga em seus braços exclamando: Eis-me de volta, meu pai, não vos zangueis se interrompo uma viagem que, segundo vossas ordens, eu devia agüentar mais tempo. O mundo é igual por toda parte e por toda parte vive de penas e trabalhos, recompensa e prazer. Mas que me importa tudo isso? Só estou bem onde tu estás, e quero sofrer e gozar na tua presença! E tu, Pai celeste e misericordioso, serias capaz de não dar ouvidos ao teu filho?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1878;if only you could breathe onto the paper in all its fullness and warmth what is so alive in you, so that it would mirror your soul;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1879;Sì certo, io sono un viandante, un pellegrino sulla terra. E che siete di meglio, voi?;Johann Wolfgang Goethe von,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1880;Kendi içime dalıyor ve içimde bir dünya buluyorum! Ama böyle yaparken düzenli ve canlı bir güçle değil, daha çok sezgiyle ve karanlık bir arzuyla hareket ediyorum. O zaman duyularım bulanıklaşmaya başlıyor ve ben, düşlerin arasında dünyaya gülümsemeye devam ediyorum.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1881;Wilhelm, wat is, voor ons hart, een leven zonder liefde!;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1882;- o gün bugündür güneş, ay ve yıldızları kendi düzenine bıraktım, ne gündüz ne gece kaldı benim için;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1883;I could not take my eyes off her dark eyes as she chattered;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1884;Buradaki insanların nasıl bir karaktere sahip olduklarını merak ediyorsan söyleyeyim ki, her yerde olduğundan farksız. Insan cinsi değişmez, her yerde aynıdır. Aşağı yukarı hepsi yaşamak için çalışıyorlar. Calışmaktan geriye kalan çok az vakitlerinde de korkuyorlar, zamanın hemen geçmesi için her şeyi yapıyorlar.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1885;Yerinde duramayan bir gezgin bile sonunda vatanını özler ve kulübesinde, eşinin koynunda, çocuklarının arasında, hepsine ekmek bulma uğraşısında dünyanın enginlerinde boşuna aradığı sevinci bulur.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1886;Übrigens befinde ich mich hier gar wohl. Die Einsamkeit ist meinem Herzen köstlicher Balsam in dieser paradiesischen Gegend, und diese Jahreszeit der Jugend wärmt mit aller Fülle mein oft schauderndes Herz. Jeder Baum, jede Hecke ist ein Strauß von Blüten, und man möchte zum Maienkäfer werden, um in dem Meer von Wohlgerüchen herumschweben und alle seine Nahrung darin finden zu können.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1887;Oraya koşup, orası da burası olunca, her şey öncesi gibidir ve zavallılığımızda, kısıntılılığımızda kalırız ve ruhumuz sıyrılan bir tesellinin hasretiyle yanar. (21 Haziran günü.);Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1888;«دوست عزیزم، من می‌خواهم و قول می‌دهم که رفتار بهتری در پیش بگیرم و دیگر آن تلخیِ کم و بیش را که سرنوشت به کام ما می‌چشاند، مثل گذشته دائم نشخوار نکنم. می‌خواهم دم را غنیمت بشمارم و گذشته را از یاد ببرم. بی‌شک حق با توست عزیزم. آدم‌ها که خدا می‌داند چرا چنین خمیره‌ای دارند، بسیار کمتر رنج می‌بردند اگر که این‌قدر به‌جای بی‌خیالی و پرداختن به اکنون، در حال و هوای خاطرات ناگوار گذشته غرق نمی‌شدند‌.»- رنج‌های ورتر جوان / یوهان ولفگانگ فون گوته;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1889;Evet Wilhelm, bazen bir an için kalkıp gitme, bağları koparma cesareti buluyorum kendimde, keşke nereye gideceğimi bilsem! heralde giderdim.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1890;Es preciso obrar con los niños como obra con nosotros el Señor, que nunca nos hace más felices que cuando nos deja embriagarnos con una ilusión agradable.;Goethe Johann Wolfgang Von,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1891;Dişimi sıkıyorum ve kendi sefaletimle alay ediyorum;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1892;Não há alegria mais verdadeira e cálida nesse mundo do que ver uma grande alma que se abre inteira para nós.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1893;Los dolores serían menores entre los hombres si éstos (Dios sabe por qué están hechos así) no se ocuparan con tanto ahínco de imaginación en evocar los recuerdos de los males pasados en vez de soportar un presente tolerable.;Johann Wolfgang Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1894;[...] car j'ai appris que tous les hommes extraordinaires qui ont fait quelque chose de grand, quelque chose qui semblait impossible, ont de tout temps été qualifiés d'ivres et d'insensés.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1895;La vida humana se reduce a un sueño;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1896;¡Ah!, lo que yo sé puede saberlo cualquiera -mi corazón no es más que mío.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1897;Ich habe so viel, und die Empfindung an ihr verschlingt alles, ich habe so viel, und ohne sie wird mir alles zu nichts.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1898;Alles in der Welt läuft doch auf eine Lumperey hinaus, und ein Kerl, der um anderer willen, ohne daß es seine eigene Leidenschaft ist, sich um Geld, oder Ehre, oder sonst was, abarbeitet, ist immer ein Thor.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1899;Los malentendidos y la pereza quizá causan más extravíos en este mundo que la astucia y la perversidad. Al menos, estas dos últimas cosas ciertamente que son más raras;Johann Wolfgang Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1900;confined as he may be, he none the less still preserves in his heart the sweet sensation of freedom, and the knowledge that he can quit this prison whenever he wishes.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1901;and yet when she speaks of her betrothed with so much warmth and affection, I feel like the soldier who has been stripped of his honours and titles, and deprived of his sword.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1902;La naturaleza humana tiene sus límites;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1903;أنا أحب حاليا اولئك المؤلفين الذين تصف مشاعرهم - اكثرما تصف- حالا مثل حالي ووضعنا مثل وضعي في الحياة.. كما احب - اكثر من سواهم- اولئك الاصدقاء من حولي الذين تثير حكايتهم اهتمامي، بما فيها من أوجه الشبه من حياتي الصميمة المألوفه، وهي حياة أن لم تكن الفردوس بحذارفيه، فهي على الجملة مصدر سعادة لا توصف.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1904;¿Qué es el hombre, ese semidiós tan ponderado? ¿No le faltan fuerzas en aquello, precisamente, que mas necesita? Bien se deje transportar por la alegría, o abrumar por el dolor, ¿no se halla igualmente detenido, igualmente obligado a reconocer la triste condición de su ser, cuando aspira orgullosamente a engolfarse en la plenitud del infinito?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1905;También les va bien a quienes otorgan pomposos títulos a sus míseras ocupaciones, o incluso a sus pasiones, y se las pintan al género humano cual gigantescas empresas destinadas a su salvación y su bienestar. ¡Afortunado el que pueda ser así! Pero quien, al contrario, reconoce en su humildad adónde conduce todo esto, quien ve cuán primorosamente el ciudadano acomodado sabe hacer de su jardincito un paraíso, y cuán diligentemente el desdichado continúa jadeante su camino bajo el peso de su carga, y que tanto uno como otro no buscan sino ver un minuto más la luz de este sol… sí, el que ve esto vive tranquilo construyendo su mundo a partir de sí mismo, y también es feliz porque es un ser humano. Y, además, limitado como es, sigue conservando en su corazón una dulce sensación de libertad y de poder abandonar esta cárcel cuando quiera.;Johann Wolfgang Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1906;Nasıl oluyor da insanı mesut eden bir şey aynı zamanda felaketinin de kaynağı oluyor?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1907;Oh, distance is like the future: before our souls lies an entire day and dusky vastness which overwhelms our feelings as it overwhelms our eyes, and ah! we long to surrender the whole of our being, and be filled with all the joy of one single, immense, magnificent emotion. And then, ah! once we hasten onwards, and what lay ahead becomes the here and now, everything is just as it was, and there we are, as poor and confined as ever, our souls longing for the elusive balm.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1908;Dear Wilhelm, I have thought a great deal about Man's desire to go out into the world, make new discoveries and go a-wandering, and, on the other hand, about that deep-seated impulse to be contented with limits that are imposed, and gladly to proceed as custom dictates, with no interest in what goes beyond the daily round.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1909;¿Por qué fatalidad ha sido preciso que lo que hace y constituye la dicha del hombre, sea tan a menudo el origen, y la causa de su infortunio?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1910;I withdraw into myself, and discover a world, albeit a notional world of dark desire rather than one of actuality and vital strength. And everything swims before my senses, and I go my way in the world wearing the smile of the dreamer.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1911;Is he only happy before he has acquired his reason, or after he has lost it?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1912;Wie oft lull' ich mein empörtes Blut zur Ruhe, denn so ungleich, so unstet hast du nichts gesehn als dieses Herz.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1913;las aflicciones de los hombres serían menores si no se empeñasen con tanta imaginación (¡Dios sabrá por qué los ha hecho así!) en rememorar los males pasados en lugar de soportar un presente anodino.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1914;Sí, querido Wilhelm, nada en el mundo está tan cerca de mi corazón como los niños. Cuando los contemplo y veo en esas cositas el germen de todas las virtudes, de todas las fuerzas que algún día habrán de serles tan necesarias, cuando vislumbro en su terquedad la futura resolución y firmeza de carácter, en sus caprichos buen humor y ligereza para esquivar los peligros del mundo, ¡todo tan íntegro, tan pleno…!, siempre, siempre repito entonces las áureas palabras del maestro de los hombres26: ¡Si no os volvéis como uno de ellos…! Y, sin embargo, mi buen amigo, a ellos, que son nuestros iguales, a los que deberíamos tener por modelo, los tratamos como si fueran súbditos.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1915;Yo amo a aquel que desea lo imposible.;goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1916;يعذبني أن أرى البشر يعذب بعضهم بعضاً.;يوهان فولفغانغ فون غوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1917;¿Es que tenía que ser así, que todo lo que hace la felicidad del hombre sea también la fuente de su desdicha?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1918;Gewiß, du hast recht, Bester, der Schmerzen wären minder unter den Menschen, wenn sie nicht - Gott weiß, warum sie so gemacht sind! - mit so viel Emsigkeit der Einbildungskraft sich beschäftigten, die Erinnerungen des vergangenen Übels zurückzurufen, eher als eine gleichgültige Gegenwart zu ertragen.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1919;Jest to pewnikiem, że tylko miłość czyni człowieka potrzebnym na świecie.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1920;¿Es preciso que lo que constituye la felicidad del hombre sea también la fuente de su miseria?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1921;You call this a weakness — beware of being led astray by appearances. When a nation, which has long groaned under the intolerable yoke of a tyrant, rises at last and throws off its chains, do you call that weakness? The man who, to rescue his house from the flames, finds his physical strength redoubled, so that he lifts burdens with ease, which, in the absence of excitement, he could scarcely move;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1922;Wenn du fragst, wie die Leute hier sind, muß ich dir sagen: wie überall! Es ist ein einförmiges Ding um das Menschengeschlecht. Die meisten verarbeiten den größten Teil der Zeit, um zu leben, und das bißchen, das ihnen von Freiheit übrig bleibt, ängstigt sie so, daß sie alle Mittel aufsuchen, um es los zu werden. O Bestimmung des Menschen!;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1923;Human nature, I continued, has its limits. It is able to endure a certain degree of joy, sorrow, and pain, but becomes annihilated as soon as this measure is exceeded. The question, therefore, is, not whether a man is strong or weak, but whether he is able to endure the measure of his sufferings. The suffering may be moral or physical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1924;"De multe ori îmi spun: ""Soarta ta e unică";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1925;Am făcut tot felul de cunoștințe, dar prieteni încă n-am găsit. De bună seamă oamenii văd în mine ceva ciudat. Mulți dintre ei mă iubesc și au simpatie față de mine, și-mi pare rău când văd că drumul nostru merge numai puțină vreme împreună. Dacă mă vei întreba cum sunt oamenii pe-aici, îți voi răspunde: ca pretutindeni. Specia umană se poartă pretutindeni la fel. Majoritatea oamenilor își întrebuințează cea mai mare parte din timp ca să trăiască și puțina libertate care le mai rămâne îi înspăimântează atât de tare, încât fac tot ce le stă în putință ca să scape de dânsa.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1926;أيها الاب السماوي الذي لست أعرفه -يا من تكرمت فملأت قلبي وقتا ما, ولكنك الآن تخفي وجهك عني- ادعني إليك مرة أخرى, ولا تعتصم بالصمت! إن صمتك لن يعوق روحًا تتعطش إليك. فأي أب يمكن أن يغضب من ابنه لأنه استدار إليه فجأة, وسقط على عنقه, هاتفًا: هأنذا قد عدت إليك يا أبي! اصفح عني إن كنت قد تعجلت الرحلة إليك, ورجعت قبل الموعد المضروب! إن العالم هو بعينه في كل مكان: مسرح هو للألم واللذة والجزاء, ولكن ما حصاد هذا كله؟ إني لست سعيدًا إلا حيث تكون أنت, وفي حضرتك وحدك يرضيني أن أعاني أو أفرح.;جوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1927;O, atât de pieritor e omul, încât chiar acolo unde are certitudinea că existența lui înseamnă ceva, acolo unde lasă cu adevărat urma prezenței lui în amintirea, în sufletul celor care îi sunt dragi, chiar și acolo urma aceasta trebuie să se stingă și să dispară, și asta atât de curând!;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1928;Das bestärkte mich in meinem Vorsatze, mich künftig allein an die Natur zu halten. Sie allein ist unendlich reich, und sie allein bildet den großen Künstler. Man kann zum Vorteile der Regeln viel sagen, ungefähr was man zum Lobe der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft sagen kann. Ein Mensch, der sich nach ihnen bildet, wird nie etwas Abgeschmacktes und Schlechtes hervorbringen, wie einer, der sich durch Gesetze und Wohlstand modeln läßt, nie ein unerträglicher Nachbar, nie ein merkwürdiger Bösewicht werden kann;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1929;Ich habe allerlei nachgedacht, über die Begier im Menschen, sich auszubreiten, neue Entdeckungen zu machen, herumzuschweifen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1930;(...) as dores não seriam tão grandes entre os homens se eles -Deus sabe por que os fez assim-, com tanto ardor de imaginação, não se empenhassem em revocar os passados dissabores em vez de aturar um presente suportável.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1931;Јас не познавам човек од кого би требало да се бојам поради Лотиното срце, но сепак - кога зборува таа за својот свршеник, и тоа со многу топлина, со толку љубов - се чувствувам как некој, којшто е лишен од сите почести и достоинства, та и мечот му го одземаат.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1932;Nun verdrießt mich nichts mehr, als wenn die Menschen einander plagen, am meisten, wenn junge Leute in der Blüte des Lebens, da sie am offensten für alle Freuden sein könnten, einander die paar guten Tage mit Fratzen verderben und nur erst zu spät das Unersetzliche ihrer Verschwendung einsehen.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1933;Ist es nicht genug, daß wir einander nicht glücklich machen können, müssen wir auch noch einander das Vergnügen rauben, das jedes Herz sich noch manchmal selbst gewähren kann? Und nennen Sie mir den Menschen, der übler Laune ist und so brav dabei, sie zu verbergen, sie allein zu tragen, ohne die Freude um sich her zu zerstören! Oder ist sie nicht vielmehr ein innerer Unmut über unsere eigene Unwürdigkeit, ein Mißfallen an uns selbst, das immer mit einem Neide verknüpft ist, der durch eine törichte Eitelkeit aufgehetzt wird? Wir sehen glückliche Menschen, die wir nicht glücklich machen, und das ist unerträglich.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1934;Bir şey də aydındır: Dünyada insanı sevdirən, yalnız məhəbbətin gücüdür.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1935;I often lose patience, when, with a glowing imagination, I am giving expression to art and nature, he interferes with learned suggestions, and uses at random the technical phraseology of artists.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1936;كم من ملك يحكمه وزراؤه، وكم من وزراء يحكمهم سكرتيرهم؟ ففي هذه الحالة من هو الرئيس الحقيقي؟;يوهان فولفغانغ فون غوته,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1937;And I mock at my heart - and then do what it demands.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1938;Wehe denen die sich der Gewalt bedienen, die sie über ein Herz haben, um ihm die einfachen Freuden zu rauben, die aus ihm selbst hervorkeimen. Alle Geschenke, alle Gefälligkeiten der Welt ersetzen nicht einen Augenblick Vergnügen an sich selbst, den uns eine neidische Unbehaglichkeit unsers Tyrannen vergällt hat.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1939;Bizdə ilk təəssürata meyil olduqca güclüdür, buna görə də doğruya oxşamayan nə varsa hamısına inanmağa hazırıq, bu təəssürat bizdə dərhal kök salıb qalır, vay o adamın halına ki, bunu çıxarıb atmağa və kökündən yox eləməyə təşəbbüs edə!;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1940;Ach, daß die Freundin meiner Jugend dahin ist, ach, daß ich sie je gekannt habe!—ich würde sagen: du bist ein Tor! Du suchst, was hienieden nicht zu finden ist! Aber ich habe sie gehabt, ich habe das Herz gefühlt, die große Seele, in deren Gegenwart ich mir schien mehr zu sein, als ich war, weil ich alles war, was ich sein konnte.;Goethe Johann W,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1941;Nə üçün insanın xoşbəxtliyini təşkil edən bir şey, həm də onun iztirablarının mənbəyi olmalıdır?;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1942;Kein Argument bringt mich so aus der Fessung, als wenn einer mit einem unbedeutenden Gemeinspruche angezogen kommt, wenn ich aus ganzem Herzen rede.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1943;İnsana üzərində xoşbəxt yaşamaq üçün bir qədər torpaq lazımdır, həmişəlik rahat olmaq üçün isə daha az torpaq gərək olur.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1944;Die menschliche Natur hat ihre Grenzen: sie kann Freude, Leid, Schmerzen bis auf einen gewissen Grad ertragen und geht zugrunde, sobald der überstiegen ist. Hier ist also nicht die Frage, ob einer schwach oder stark ist, sondern ob er das Maß seines Leidens ausdauern kann, es mag nun moralisch oder körperlich sein. Und ich finde es ebenso wunderbar zu sagen, der Mensch ist feige, der sich das Leben nimmt, als es ungehorig wäre, den einen Feigen zu nennen, der an einem bösartigen Fieber stirbt.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1945;Cuando el hombre no se encuentra a sí mismo, no encuentra nada.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1949;(…) No quiere esto decir que este género de literatura haya perdido a mis ojos todos sus encantos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1950;Un hombre formado según las reglas, jamás producirá nada absurdo y absolutamente malo, así como el que obra con sujeción a las leyes y a la urbanidad nunca puede ser un vecino insoportable ni un gran malvado. Sin embargo, y dígase lo que se quiera, toda regla asfixia los verdaderos sentimientos y destruye la verdadera expresión de la naturaleza.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1951;Parece que se ha levantado un velo delante de mi alma, y el escenario de la vida infinita no se transforma a mis ojos en el abismo de la tumba, eternamente abierta. ¿Puedes decir esto existe cuando todo pasa, cuando todo se precipita con la velocidad del rayo, sin conservar casi nunca sus fuerzas, y se ve, ¡ay!, encadenado, tragado por el torrente, y despedazado contra las rocas? No hay un momento que no te consuma, que no consuma los tuyos;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1952;Когда несчастье или неожиданное потрясение настигают нас посреди удовольствия, вполне естественно, что они действуют сильнее, отчасти уже по контрасту, но главным образом потому, что чувства наши тут особенно обострены и, значит, мы тем легче поддаемся впечатлениям.;Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1960;Love...no such thing.Whatever it is that binds families and married couples together, that's not love. That's stupidity or selfishness or fear. Love doesn't exist. Self interest exists, attachment based on personal gain exists, complacency exists. But not love. Love has to be reinvented, that’s certain.;Arthur Rimbaud,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1961;A thousand Dreams within me softly burn:From time to time my heart is like some oakWhose blood runs golden where a branch is torn.;Arthur Rimbaud,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1964;A poet makes himself a visionary through a long, boundless, and systematized disorganization of all the senses. All forms of love, of suffering, of madness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1965;I shed more tears than God could ever have required.;Arthur Rimbaud,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1974;Come from forever, and you will go everywhere.;Arthur Rimbaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1975;My turn now. The story of one of my insanities.For a long time I boasted that I was master of all possible landscapes-- and I thought the great figures of modern painting and poetry were laughable.What I liked were: absurd paintings, pictures over doorways, stage sets, carnival backdrops, billboards, bright-colored prints, old-fashioned literature, church Latin, erotic books full of misspellings, the kind of novels our grandmothers read, fairy tales, little children's books, old operas, silly old songs, the naive rhythms of country rimes.I dreamed of Crusades, voyages of discovery that nobody had heard of, republics without histories, religious wars stamped out, revolutions in morals, movements of races and continents;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1976;But the problem is to make the soul into a monster;Arthur Rimbaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1977;I have stretched ropes from steeple to steeple;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1978;On the blue summer evenings, I will go along the paths,And walk over the short grass, as I am pricked by the wheat:Daydreaming I will feel the coolness on my feet.I will let the wind bathe my bare head. I will not speak,I will have no thoughts: But infinite love will mount in my soul;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1979;I is another. If the brass wakes the trumpet, it’s not its fault. That’s obvious to me: I witness the unfolding of my own thought: I watch it, I hear it: I make a stroke with the bow: the symphony begins in the depths, or springs with a bound onto the stage.If the old imbeciles hadn’t discovered only the false significance of Self, we wouldn’t have to now sweep away those millions of skeletons which have been piling up the products of their one-eyed intellect since time immemorial, and claiming themselves to be their authors!;Arthur Rimbaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1988;Now I am an outcast. I loathe my country. The best thing for me is a drunken sleep on the beach.;Arthur Rimbaud,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1989;The wolf howled under the leavesAnd spit out the prettiest feathersOf his meal of fowl:Like him I consume myself.;Arthur Rimbaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1990;The first study for the man who wants to be a poet is knowledge of himself, complete: he searches for his soul, he inspects it, he puts it to the test, he learns it. As soon as he has learned it, he must cultivate it! I say that one must be a seer, make oneself a seer. The poet becomes a seer through a long, immense, and reasoned derangement of all the senses. All shapes of love suffering, madness. He searches himself, he exhausts all poisons in himself, to keep only the quintessences. Ineffable torture where he needs all his faith, all his superhuman strength, where he becomes among all men the great patient, the great criminal, the great accursed one--and the supreme Scholar! For he reaches the unknown! ....So the poet is actually a thief of Fire!;Arthur Rimbaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1991;True life is elsewhere;Arthur Rimbaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

And in that instant I could feel myself with him gone, dizzy with fear, sinking down into the most horrible blackness: into death.";Arthur Rimbaud,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1996;I'm now making myself as scummy as I can. Why? I want to be a poet, and I'm working at turning myself into a seer. You won't understand any of this, and I'm almost incapable of explaining it to you. The idea is to reach the unknown by the derangement of all the senses. It involves enormous suffering, but one must be strong and be a born poet. It's really not my fault.;Arthur Rimbaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1997;What am I doing here?;Arthur Rimbaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1998;You will always be a hyena.;Arthur Rimbaud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2006;I am the saint at prayer on the terrace like the peaceful beasts that graze down to the sea of Palestine.I am the scholar of the dark armchair. Branches and rain hurl themselves at the windows of my library.I am the pedestrian of the highroad by way of the dwarf woods;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2016;I saw myself before an infuriated mob, facing the firing squad, weeping out of pity for the evil they could not understand, and forgiving!-Like Jeanne d'Arc!-'Priests, professors, masters, you are making a mistake in turning me over to the law. I have never belonged to this people;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2028;Evening prayerI spend my life sitting, like an angel in a barber's chair,Holding a beer mug with deep-cut designs,My neck and gut both bent, while in the airA weightless veil of pipe smoke hangs.Like steaming dung within an old dovecoteA thousand Dreams within me softly burn:From time to time my heart is like some oakWhose blood runs golden where a branch is torn.And then, when I have swallowed down my DreamsIn thirty, forty mugs of beer, I turnTo satisfy a need I can't ignore,And like the Lord of Hyssop and of MyrrhI piss into the skies, a soaring streamThat consecrates a patch of flowering fern.;Arthur Rimbaud,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Bir akşam, Güzelliği dizlerimin üstüne oturttum. -Ve onu çok acı buldum.- Ve sövdüm ona. Adalete karşı önlem aldım. Kaçtım uzaklara. Ey büyücüler, ey sefillik, ey kin, hazinem size emanet! Kafamdaki tüm insani umutları yok etmeyi başardım. Her sevincin üstüne sıçradım bir vahşi hayvan gibi boğmaz için. Yanıma cellatlar çağırdım, ölürken, tüfeklerinin dipçiklerini ısırayım diye. Belalar çağırdım, kumla, kanla beni boğsunlar diye. Mutsuzluk ilahım oldu. Çamura uzandım boylu boyuna. Cinayet havasıyla kurulandım. Ve nice oyunlar oynadım delicesine. Ve ilkbahar getirdi bana budalalığın ürkütücü gülümsemesini.;Arthur Rimbaud,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2166;Far from birds, from flocks and village girls, What did I drink, on my knees in the heather Surrounded by a sweet wood of hazel trees, In the warm and green mist of the afternoon? What could I drink from that young Oise, − Voiceless elms, flowerless grass, an overcast sky! − Drinking from these yellow gourds, far from the hut I loved? Some golden spirit that made me sweat. I would have made a dubious sign for an inn. − A storm came to chase the sky away. In the evening Water from the woods sank into the virgin sand, And God’s wind threw ice across the ponds. Weeping, I saw gold − but could not drink. − ——— At four in the morning, in the summer, The sleep of love still continues. Beneath the trees the wind disperses The smells of the evening feast. Over there, in their vast wood yard, Under the sun of the Hesperidins, Already hard at work − in shirtsleeves − Are the Carpenters. In their Deserts of moss, quietly, They raise precious panelling Where the city Will paint fake skies. O for these Workers, charming Subjects of a Babylonian king, Venus!

What hearts shall I break? What lie maintain? - Through what blood wade?Better to keep away from justice. - A hard life, outright stupor, - with a dried-out fist to lift the coffin lid, lie down, and suffocate. No old age this way, no danger: terror is very un-French.- Ah! I am so forsaken I will offer at any shrine impulses toward perfection.Oh my self-denial, my marvelous Charity! my Selfless love!

2203;NOAPTEA IADULUI Am dat pe gât o straşnică înghiţitură de otravă.De trei ori binecuvântat să fie sfatul ce ni s-a dat!

2213;The first study for the man who wants to be a poet is knowledge of himself, complete: he searches for his soul, he inspects it, he puts it to the test, he learns it. As soon as he has learned it, he must cultivate it! I say that one must be a seer, make oneself a seer. The poet becomes a seer through a long, immense, and reasoned derangement of all the senses. All shapes of love suffering, madness. He searches himself, he exhausts all poisons in himself, to keep only the quintessences. Ineffable torture where he needs all his faith, all his superhuman strength, where he becomes among all men the great patient, the great criminal, the great accursed one--and the supreme Scholar! For he reaches the unknown! ....So the poet is actually a thief of Fire! ― Arthur Rimbaud, Rimbaud Complete. (Modern Library;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2220;AFTER THE DELUGE AS SOON as the idea of the Deluge had subsided, A hare stopped in the clover and swaying flower-bells, and said a prayer to the rainbow, through the spider’s web. Oh! the precious stones that began to hide,—and the flowers that already looked around. In the dirty main street, stalls were set up and boats were hauled toward the sea, high tiered as in old prints. Blood flowed at Blue Beard’s,—through slaughterhouses, in circuses, where the windows were blanched by God’s seal. Blood and milk flowed. Beavers built. Mazagrans smoked in the little bars. In the big glass house, still dripping, children in mourning looked at the marvelous pictures. A door banged;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2221;One night, I sat Beauty on my knee. —And I found her bitter. —And I hurt her.I took arms against justice.I fled, entrusting my treasure to you, o witches, o misery, o hate.I snuffed any hint of human hope from my consciousness. I made the muffled leap of a wild beast onto any hint of joy, to strangle it.Dying, I called out to my executioners so I could bite the butts of their rifles. I called plagues to suffocate me with sand, blood. Misfortune was my god. I wallowed in the mud. I withered in criminal air. And I even tricked madness more than once.And spring gave me an idiot’s unbearable laughter.Just now, having nearly reached death’s door, I even considered seeking the key to the old feast, through which, perhaps, I might regain my appetite.[...] A hyena you’ll remain, etc.…  cries the demon that crowns me with merry poppies.

2226;On the roads, through winter nights, without a home, without habits, without bread, a voice strangled my frozen heart: Weakness or strength: Those are your options, so strength it is.

2235;I explained my magical sophisms with hallucinations of words!I ended up believing my spiritual disorder sacred. I was lazy, proof of my fever: I envied the happiness of animals—caterpillars, symbolic of the innocence of limbo;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2236;Madness—the kind you lock away—breeds sophistries, and I haven’t avoided a single one. I could list them all: I’ve got them down.My health suffered. Terror struck. I’d sleep for days, and, risen, such sad dreams would stay with me. I was ripe for death, and down a dangerous road my weakness drew me to the edges of the earth and on to Cimmeria, that dark country of winds.I sought voyages, to disperse enchantments that had colonized my mind.Above a sea I came to love as if it were rinsing me of stain, I watched a consoling cross rise. Damnation, in the shape of a rainbow. Bliss was my undoing, my remorse, my worm: my life would always be too ungovernable to devote to strength and beauty.;Arthur Rimbaud,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

O witches, O misery, O hatred, my treasure's been turned over to you!I managed to make every trace of human hope vanish from my mind. I pounced on every joy like a ferocious animal eager to strangle it.I called for executioners so that, while dying, I could bite the butts of their rifles. I called for plagues to choke me with sand, with blood. Bad luck was my god. I stretched out in the muck. I dried myself in the air of crime. And I played tricks on insanity.And Spring brought me the frightening laugh of the idiot.So, just recently, when I found myself on the brink of the final squawk! it dawned on me to look again for the key to that ancient party where I might find my appetite once more.Charity is that key.—This inspiration proves I was dreaming!""You'll always be a hyena etc. . . ,"" yells the devil, who'd crowned me with such pretty poppies.

2333;It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if he had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2334;Yours(now I'm even losing my name - it was getting shorter and shorter all the time and is now: Yours);Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2335;My peers, lately, have found companionship through means of intoxication--it makes them sociable. I, however, cannot force myself to use drugs to cheat on my loneliness--it is all that I have--and when the drugs and alcohol dissipate, will be all that my peers have as well.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2341;Written kisses don't reach their destination, rather they are drunk on the way by the ghosts.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2342;We photograph things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way of shutting my eyes.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2343;The truth is always an abyss. One must — as in a swimming pool — dare to dive from the quivering springboard of trivial everyday experience and sink into the depths, in order to later rise again — laughing and fighting for breath — to the now doubly illuminated surface of things.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2344;We are as forlorn as children lost in the wood. When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours? And if I were to cast myself down before you and tell you, what more would you know about me that you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful?;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2345;From a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back. That is the point that must be reached.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2346;I dream of a grave, deep and narrow, where we could clasp each other in our arms as with clamps, and I would hide my face in you and you would hide your face in me, and nobody would ever see us any more;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2347;Just think how many thoughts a blanket smothers while one lies alone in bed, and how many unhappy dreams it keeps warm.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2348;Last night I dreamed about you. What happened in detail I can hardly remember, all I know is that we kept merging into one another. I was you, you were me. Finally you somehow caught fire.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2349;Kill me, or you are a murderer.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2350;What am I doing here in this endless winter?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2351;You are free and that is why you are lost.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2352;All I am is literature, and I am not able or willing to be anything else.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2353;We need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2354;You are at once both the quiet and the confusion of my heart;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2355;They're talking about things of which they don't have the slightest understanding, anyway. It's only because of their stupidity that they're able to be so sure of themselves.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2356;Do you know, darling? When you became involved with others you quite possibly stepped down a level or two, but If you become involved with me, you will be throwing yourself into the abyss.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2357;it is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary.' 'A melancholy conclusion,' said K. 'It turns lying into a universal principle.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2358;I am dirty, Milena, endlessly dirty, that is why I make such a fuss about cleanliness. None sing as purely as those in deepest hell;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2360;Was he an animal, that music could move him so? He felt as if the way to the unknown nourishment he longed for were coming to light.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2361;sleep is the most innocent creature there is and a sleepless manthe most guilty.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2362;The Kafka paradox: art depends on truth, but truth, being indivisable, cannot know itself: to tell the truth is to lie. thus the writer is the truth, and yet when he speaks he lies.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2363;Please — consider me a dream.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2364;The limited circle is pure.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2365;Logic may indeed be unshakeable, but it cannot withstand a man who is determined to live.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2366;We are as forlorn as children lost in the woods. When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours. And if I were to cast myself down before you and weep and tell you, what more would you know about me than you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful? For that reason alone we human beings ought to stand before one another as reverently, as reflectively, as lovingly, as we would before the entrance to Hell.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2367;When one is alone, imperfection must be endured every minute of the day;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2368;I have hardly anything in common with myself and should stand very quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2371;"Alas,"" said the mouse, ""the whole world is growing smaller every day. At the beginning it was so big that I was afraid, I kept running and running, and I was glad when I saw walls far away to the right and left, but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that I am in the last chamber already, and there in the corner stands the trap that I must run into."" ""You only need to change your direction,"" said the cat, and ate it up.";Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2372;He thought back on his family with deep emotion and love. His conviction that he would have to disappear was, if possible, even firmer than his sister's. He remained in this state of empty and peaceful reflection until the tower clock struck three in the morning. He still saw that outside the window everything was beginning to grow light. Then, without his consent, his head sank down to the floor, and from his nostrils streamed his last weak breath.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2373;Anyone who keeps the ability to see beauty never grows old.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2374;There art two cardinal sins from which all others spring: Impatience and Laziness.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2383;Even if no salvation should come, I want to be worthy of it at every moment.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2384;I am not well;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2385;Life's splendor forever lies in wait about each one of us in all its fullness, but veiled from view, deep down, invisible, far off. It is there, though, not hostile, not reluctant, not deaf. If you summon it by the right word, by its right name, it will come.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2386;Nervous states of the worst sort control me without pause. Everything that is not literature bores me and I hate it. I lack all aptitude for family life except, at best, as an observer. I have no family feeling and visitors make me almost feel as though I were maliciously being attacked.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2387;I’m thinking only of my illness and my health, though both, the first as well as the second, are you.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2388;Sometimes I have the feeling that we're in one room with two opposite doors and each of us holds the handle of one door, one of us flicks an eyelash and the other is already behind his door, and now the first one has but to utter a word ad immediately the second one has closed his door behind him and can no longer be seen. He's sure to open the door again for it's a room which perhaps one cannot leave. If only the first one were not precisely like the second, if he were calm, if he would only pretend not to look at the other, if he slowly set the room in order as though it were a room like any other;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2389;Forget everything. Open the windows. Clear the room. The wind blows through it. You see only its emptiness, you search in every corner and don’t find yourself.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2390;If I could drown in sleep as I drown in fear I would be no longer alive.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2391;Anyone who cannot cope with life while he is alive needs one hand to ward off a little his despair over his fate...but with his other hand he can jot down what he sees among the ruins, for he sees different and more things than the others;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2392;I am always trying to convey something that can’t be conveyed, to explain something which is inexplicable, to tell about something I have in my bones, something which can be expressed only in the bones.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2393;Should I be grateful or should I curse the fact that despite all misfortune I can still feel love, an unearthly love but still for earthly objects.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2394;Hold fast to the diary from today on! Write regularly! Don't surrender! Even if no salvation should come, I want to be worthy of it every moment.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2395;He was a tool of the boss, without brains or backbone.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2396;The right understanding of any matter and a misunderstanding of the same matter do not wholly exclude each other.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2397;Being alone has a power over me that never fails. My interior dissolves (for the time being only superficially) and is ready to release what lies deeper. When I am willfully alone, a slight ordering of my interior begins to take place and I need nothing more.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2398;I long for you;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2399;Dear Milena,I wish the world were ending tomorrow. Then I could take the next train, arrive at your doorstep in Vienna, and say: Come with me, Milena. We are going to love each other without scruples or fear or restraint. Because the world is ending tomorrow. Perhaps we don’t love unreasonably because we think we have time, or have to reckon with time. But what if we don't have time? Or what if time, as we know it, is irrelevant? Ah, if only the world were ending tomorrow. We could help each other very much.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2400;The books we need are of the kind that act upon us like a misfortune, that makes us suffer like the death of someone we love more than ourselves, that make us feel as though we were on the verge of suicide, lost in a forest remote from all human habitation.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2401;Nothing unites two people so completely, especially if, like you and me, all they have is words.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2402;But I’m not guilty, said K. there’s been a mistake. How is it even possible for someone to be guilty? We’re all human beings here, one like the other. That is true said the priest but that is how the guilty speak;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2403;The person I am in the company of my sisters has been entirely different from the person I am in the company of other people. Fearless, powerful, surprising, moved as I otherwise am only when I write.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2404;I lack nothing. I only needed myself.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2405;I do not read advertisements. I would spend all of my time wanting things. ;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2406;Every revolution evaporates and leaves behind only the slime of a new bureaucracy.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2407;So eager are our people to obliterate the present.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2408;You misinterpret everything, even the silence.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2409;Even the merest gesture is holy if it is filled with faith.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2410;I am too tired, I must try to rest and sleep, otherwise I am lost in every respect. What an effort to keep alive! Erecting a monument does not require an expenditure of so much strength.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2411;What's happened to me,' he thought. It was no dream.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2412;But sleep? On a night like this? What an idea! Just think of how many thoughts a blanket smothers while one lies alone in bed, and how many unhappy dreams it keeps warm.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2413;Calm —indeed the calmest— reflection might be better than the most confused decisions;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2414;Someone must have slandered Josef K., for one morning, without having done anything truly wrong, he was arrested.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2415;If a man has his eyes bound, you can encourage him as much as you like to stare through the bandage, but he'll never see anything.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2416;You once said that you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2417;Everyone carries a room about inside him. This fact can even be proved by means of the sense of hearing. If someone walks fast and one pricks up one’s ears and listens, say in the night, when everything round about is quiet, one hears, for instance, the rattling of a mirror not quite firmly fastened to the wall.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2418;Pienso que sólo debemos leer libros de los que muerden y pinchan. Si el libro que estamos leyendo no nos obliga a despertarnos como un puñetazo en la cara, ¿para qué molestarnos en leerlo? ¿Para que nos haga felices, como dice tu carta? Cielo santo, ¡seríamos igualmente felices si no tuviéramos ningún libro! Los libros que nos hagan felices podríamos escribirlos nosotros mismos, si no nos quedara otro remedio. Lo que necesitamos son libros que nos golpeen como una desgracia dolorosa, como la muerte de alguien a quien queríamos más que a nosotros mismos, libros que nos hagan sentirnos desterrados a los bosques más remotos, lejos de toda presencia humana, algo semejante al suicidio. Un libro debe ser el hacha que rompa el mar helado dentro de nosotros. Eso es lo que creo.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2419;2 November. This morning, for the first time in a long time, the joy again of imagining a knife twisted in my heart.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2420;My condition is not unhappiness, but it is also not happiness, not indifference, not weakness, not fatigue, not another interest – so what is it then?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2421;Every thing you love is very likely to be lost, but in the end, love will return in a different way.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2422;What do I have in common with Jews? I don't even have anything in common with myself. ;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2423;The sister played so beautifully. Her face was tilted to one side and she followed the notes with soulful and probing eyes. Gregor advanced a little, keeping his eyes low so that they might possibly meet hers. Was he a beast if music could move him so?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2424;One has either to take people as they are, or leave them as they are. One cannot change them, one can merely disturb their balance. A human being, after all, is not made up of single pieces, from which a single piece can be taken out and replaced by something else.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2425;You must not pay too much attention to opinions. The written word is unalterable, and opinions are often only an expression of despair.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2426;I can’t feel a thing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2427;Writing is a deeper sleep than death. Just as one wouldn't pull a corpse from its grave, I can't be dragged from my desk at night.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2428;I only fear danger where I want to fear it.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2429;If the book we are reading does not wake us, as with a fist hammering on our skull, why then do we read it?;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2430;So then you’re free?’ ‘Yes, I’m free,’ said Karl, and nothing seemed more worthless than his freedom.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2431;I can't think of anything to write about, I'm just walking around here between the lines, under the light of your eyes, in the breadth of your mouth as in a beautiful happy day, which remains beautiful and happy, even when the head is sick and tired.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2432;Go on caring for me.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2433;Self-control is something for which I do not strive. Self-control means wanting to be effective at some random point in the infinite radiations of my spiritual existence.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2434;Si el libro que leemos no nos despierta de un puñetazo en el cráneo, ¿para qué leerlo?… Un libro tiene que ser un hacha que rompa el mar de hielo que llevamos dentro.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2435;Now the Sirens have a still more fatal weapon than their song, namely their silence... someone might possibly have escaped from their singing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2436;What a fate: to be condemned to work for a firm where the slightest negligence at once gave rise to the gravest suspicion! Were all the employees nothing but a bunch of scoundrels, was there not among them one single loyal devoted man who, had he wasted only an hour or so of the firm's time in the morning, was so tormented by conscience as to be driven out of his mind and actually incapable of leaving his bed?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2437;Writing is prayer.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2438;Nor is it perhaps really love when I say that for me you are the most beloved;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2439;... it is, after all, not necessary to fly right into the middle of the sun, but it is necessary to crawl to a clean little spot on Earth where the sun sometimes shines and one can warm oneself a little.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2440;There's no quiet place here on earth for our love, not in the village and not anywhere else, so I picture a grave, deep and narrow, in which we embrace as if clamped together, I bury my face against you, you yours against me, and no one will ever see us.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2441;I’m doing badly, I’m doing well;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2442;What I write is different from what I say, what I say is different from what I think, what I think is different from what I ought to think and so it goes further into the deepest darkness.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2443;It is not necessary to accept everything as true, one must only accept it as necessary;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2444;"it was like this. the brain could no longer bear the worries and pains that were imposed on it. it said: ""i'm giving up";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2445;It would be very unjust to say that you deserted me, but that I was deserted, and sometimes terribly so, is true.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2446;It is only because of their stupidity that they are able to be so sure of themselves.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2447;I carry the bars within me.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2448;"the blend of absurd, surreal and mundane which gave rise to the adjective ""kafkaesque";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2449;August 2, 1914: Germany has declared war on Russia. Went swimming in the afternoon.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2450;It seems to be a fact that man, tortured by his demons, avenges himself blindly on his fellow-man.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2451;And don't demand any sincerity from me, Milena. No one can demand it from me more than I myself and yet many things elude me, I'm sure, perhaps everything eludes me.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2452;"Like a dog!"" he said, it was as if the shame of it should outlive him.";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2453;All knowledge, the totality of all questions and answers, is contained in the dog.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2454;I feel an unhappiness which almost dismembers me, and at the same time am convinced of its necessity;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2455;If you become involved with me, you will be throwing yourself into the abyss.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2456;I like to make use of what I know;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2457;There has never been a time in which I have been convinced from within myself that I am alive. You see, I have only such a fugitive awareness of things around me that I always feel they were once real and are now fleeting away. I have a constant longing, my dear sir, to catch a glimpse of things as they may have been before they show themselves to me. I feel that they were calm and beautiful. It must be so, for I often hear people talking about them as though they were.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2458;the poisonous world flows into my mouth like water into that of a drowning man;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2459;Life is merely terrible;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2460;One must fight to get to the top, especially if one starts at the bottom.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2461;Every word first looks around in every direction before letting itself be written down by me.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2462;Milena - what a rich heavy name, almost too full to be lifted, and in the beginning I didn't like it much, it seemed to me a Greek or Roman gone astray in Bohemia, violated by Czech, cheated of its accent, and yet in colour and form it is marvellously a woman, a woman whom one carries in one's arms out of the world, and out of the fire, I don't know which, and she presses herself willingly and trustingly into your arms.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2463;Each of us has his own way of emerging from the underworld, mine is by writing. That's why the only way I can keep going, if at all, is by writing, not through rest and sleep. I am far more likely to achieve peace of mind through writing than the capacity to write through peace.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2464;If the book we are reading does not wake us, as with a fist hammering on our skulls, then why do we read it? Good God, we also would be happy if we had no books and such books that make us happy we could, if need be, write ourselves. What we must have are those books that come on us like ill fortune, like the death of one we love better than ourselves, like suicide. A book must be an ice axe to break the sea frozen inside us.What we need are books that hit us like a most painful misfortune, like the death of someone we loved more than we love ourselves, that make us feel as though we had been banished to the woods, far from any human presence, like a suicide. A book must be the ax for the frozen sea within us.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2465;I see, these books are probably law books, and it is an essential part of the justice dispensed here that you should be condemned not only in innocence but also in ignorance.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2466;There is a destination but no way there;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2467;"Many complain that the words of the wise are always merely parables and of no use in daily life, which is the only life we have. When the sage says: ""Go over,"" he does not mean that we should cross over to some actual place, which we could do anyhow if the labor were worth it";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2468;German is my mother tongue and as such more natural to me, but I consider Czech much more affectionate, which is why your letter removes several uncertainties;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2469;"Before he dies, all his experiences in these long years gather themselves in his head to one point, a ques-tion he has not yet asked the doorkeeper. He waves him nearer, since he can no longer raise his stiffening body. The doorkeeper has to bend low towards him, for the difference in height between them has altered much to the man's disadvantage. ""What do you want to know now?"" asks the doorkeeper";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2476;Since I met you, I've felt abandoned without your nearness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2477;Before the Law stands a doorkeeper on guard. To this doorkeeper there comes a man from the country who begs for admittance to the Law. But the doorkeeper says that he cannot admit the man at the moment. The man, on reflection, asks if he will be allowed, then, to enter later. 'It is possible,' answers the doorkeeper, 'but not at this moment.' Since the door leading into the Law stands open as usual and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man bends down to peer through the entrance. When the doorkeeper sees that, he laughs and says: 'If you are so strongly tempted, try to get in without my permission. But note that I am powerful. And I am only the lowest doorkeeper. From hall to hall keepers stand at every door, one more powerful than the other. Even the third of these has an aspect that even I cannot bear to look at.' These are difficulties which the man from the country has not expected to meet, the Law, he thinks, should be accessible to every man and at all times, but when he looks more closely at the doorkeeper in his furred robe, with his huge pointed nose and long, thin, Tartar beard, he decides that he had better wait until he gets permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at the side of the door. There he sits waiting for days and years. He makes many attempts to be allowed in and wearies the doorkeeper with his importunity. The doorkeeper often engages him in brief conversation, asking him about his home and about other matters, but the questions are put quite impersonally, as great men put questions, and always conclude with the statement that the man cannot be allowed to enter yet. The man, who has equipped himself with many things for his journey, parts with all he has, however valuable, in the hope of bribing the doorkeeper. The doorkeeper accepts it all, saying, however, as he takes each gift: 'I take this only to keep you from feeling that you have left something undone.' During all these long years the man watches the doorkeeper almost incessantly. He forgets about the other doorkeepers, and this one seems to him the only barrier between himself and the Law. In the first years he curses his evil fate aloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2478;My doubts stand in a circle around every word, I see them before I see the word, but what then! I do not see the word at all, I invent it.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2479;Ich glaube, man sollte überhaupt nur solche Bücher lesen, die einen beißen und stechen. Wenn das Buch, das wir lesen, uns nicht mit einem Faustschlag auf den Schädel weckt, wozu lesen wir dann das Buch? Damit es uns glücklich macht, wie Du schreibst? Mein Gott, glücklich wären wir eben auch, wenn wir keine Bücher hätten, und solche Bücher, die uns glücklich machen, könnten wir zur Not selber schreiben. Wir brauchen aber die Bücher, die auf uns wirken wie ein Unglück, das uns sehr schmerzt, wie der Tod eines, den wir lieber hatten als uns, wie wenn wir in Wälder vorstoßen würden, von allen Menschen weg, wie ein Selbstmord, ein Buch muß die Axt sein für das gefrorene Meer in uns.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2484;Apenas se deviam ler os livros que nos picam e que nos mordem. Se o livro que lemos não nos desperta como um murro no crânio, para quê lê-lo?;F. Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2485;The fact that no one knows where I am is my only happiness. If only I could prolong this forever! It would be far more just than death. I am empty and futile in every corner of my being, even in my unhappiness.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2486;And so gentlemen, I learned. Oh, if you have to learn, you learn;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2487;For we are like tree trunks in the snow. In appearance they lie smoothly and a little push should be enough to set them rolling. No, it can't be done, for they are firmly wedded to the ground. But see, even that is only appearance.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2488;There they lay, but not in the forgetfulness of the previous night. She was seeking and he was seeking, they raged and contorted their faces and bored their heads into each others bosom in the urgency of seeking something, and their embraces and their tossing limbs did not avail to make them forget, but only reminded them of what they sought;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2489;But Gregor understood easily that it was not only consideration for him which prevented their moving, for he could easily have been transported in a suitable crate with a few air holes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2490;If this is what you came for, then I didn't send for you. Kafka (note to himself in journal);Kafka, Franz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2491;"My ""fear"" is my substance, and probably the best part of me.";Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2492;The true way goes over a rope which is not stretched at any great height but just above the ground. It seems more designed to make people stumble than to be walked upon.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2493;there is nothing bad to fear;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2494;I'm on such a dangerous road, Milena. You're standing firmly near a tree, young, beautiful, your eyes subduing with their radiance the suffering world.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2495;I stand on the end platform of the tram and am completely unsure of my footing in this world, in this town, in my family. Not even casually could I indicate any claims that I might rightly advance in any direction. I have not even any defense to offer for standing on this platform, holding on to this strap, letting myself be carried along by this tram, nor for the people who give way to the tram or walk quietly along or stand gazing into shop windows. Nobody asks me to put up a defense, indeed, but that is irrelevant.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2496;I can prove at any time that my education tried to make another person out of me than the one I became. It is for the harm, therefore, that my educators could have done me in accordance with their intentions that I reproach them;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2497;One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous bug…;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2498;People keep themselves at a tolerable height above an infernal abyss toward which they gravitate only by putting out all their strength and lovingly helping one another. They are tied together by ropes, and it's bad enough when the ropes around an individual loosen and he drops somewhat lower than the others into empty space;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2499;You will get to know me better;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2500;No one can crave what truly harms him.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2501;You too have weapons.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2502;Lost among these entirely strange people.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2503;Don't despair, not even over the fact that you don't despair. Just when everything seems over with, new forces come marching up, and precisely that means that you are alive. And if they don't, then everything is over with here, once and for all.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2504;There can be no more beautiful spot to die in, no spot more worthy of total despair, than one’s own novel.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2505;No, I didn't imagine my being alone with you the way you do. If I want the impossible, I want it in its entirety. Entirely alone, dearest, I wanted us to be entirely alone on this earth, entirely alone under the sky, and to lead my life, my life that is yours, without distraction and with complete concentration, in you.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2506;My job is unbearable to me because it conflicts with my only desire and my only calling, which is literature. Since I am nothing but literature and can and want to be nothing else, my job will never take possession of me, it may, however, shatter me completely, and this is by no means a remote possibility.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2507;I have no memory for things I have learned, nor things I have read, nor things experienced or heard, neither for people nor events;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2508;"Don't you want to join us?"" I was recently asked by an acquaintance when he ran across me alone after midnight in a coffeehouse that was already almost deserted. ""No, I don't,"" I said.";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2509;Leop­ards break in­to the tem­ple and drink all the sac­ri­fi­cial ves­sels dry;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2510;One must lie low, no matter how much it went against the grain, and try to understand that this great organization remained, so to speak, in a state of delicate balance, and that if someone took it upon himself to alter the dispositions of things around him, he ran the risk of losing his footing and falling to destruction, while the organization would simply right itself by some compensating reaction in another part of its machinery – since everything interlocked – and remain unchanged, unless, indeed, which was very probable, it became still more rigid, more vigilant, severer, and more ruthless.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2511;The door could not be heard slamming;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2512;But I will write in spite of everything, absolutely;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2513;I didn’t want any new clothes at all;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2514;Let the future sleep for now, as it deserves. If you wake it too early, you get a groggy present.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2515;Art flies around truth, but with the definite intention of not getting burnt. Its capacity lies in finding in the dark void a place where the beam of light can be intensely caught, without this having been perceptible before.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2516;I mustn't look at you too much, or I won't be able to take my eyes off you at all.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2517;Like a Dog!;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2518;It receives you when you come and dismisses you when you go.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2519;Test yourself on mankind. It is something that makes the doubter doubt, the believer believe.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2520;The man in ecstasy and the man drowning—both throw up their arms.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2521;It is as if a person were a prisoner, and he had not only the intention to escape, which would perhaps be attainable, but also, and indeed simultaneously, the intention to rebuild the prison as a pleasure dome for himself. But if he escapes, he cannot rebuild, and if he rebuilds, he cannot escape.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2522;Our winters are very long here, very long and very monotonous. But we don't complain about it downstairs, we're shielded against the winter. Oh, spring does come eventually, and summer, and they last for a while, but now, looking back, spring and summer seem too short, as if they were not much more than a couple of days, and even on those days, no matter how lovely the day, it still snows occasionally.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2523;By your side I’m most quiet and most unquiet, most inhibited and most free.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2524;Conversations bore me, to visit people bores me, the sorrows and joys of my relatives bore me to my soul.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2525;But what if all the tranquility, all the comfort, all the contentment were now to come to a horrifying end?;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2526;If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2527;Like tired dogs they stand there,because they use up all their strengthin remaining upright in one's memory.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2528;My grandfather used to say: Life is astoundingly short. To me, looking back over it, life seems so foreshortened that I scarcely understand, for instance, how a young man can decide to ride over to the next village without being afraid that -not to mention accidents- even the span of a normal happy life may fall far short of the time needed for such a journey.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2529;I am away from home and must always write home, even if any home of mine has long since floated away into eternity.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2530;It occurs to me that I really can't remember your face in any precise detail. Only the way you walked away through the tables in the café, your figure, your dress, that I still see.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2531;You are so vulnerably haunting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2532;Altogether, I think we ought to read only books that bite and sting us. If the book we are reading doesn’t shake us awake like a blow to the skull, why bother reading it in the first place? So that it can make us happy, as you put it? Good God, we’d be just as happy if we had no books at all;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2533;Maybe innocence makes its way easiest through the elemental chaos of this world...;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2534;This perversion of the truth, familiar to the artist though it was, always unnerved him afresh and proved too much for him. What was a consequence of the premature ending of his fast was here presented as the cause of it! To fight against this lack of understanding, against a whole world of nonunderstanding, was impossible.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2535;"كتابة الرسائل .. تعني أن تعري نفسكَ أمام الأشباح ، و هو شيء لطالما كانوا ينتظرونه بفارغ الصبر. كتابة القُبل فيها لا يعني أنها ستصل إلى مكانها المقصود ، بينما على العكس ، يتخطفها الأشباح على طول الطريق.""(كافكا إلى ميلينا)";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2536;Some deny the existence of misery by pointing to the sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2537;Illusions are more common than changes in fortune;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2538;They did not know what we can now sense as we contemplate the course of history: that change begins in the soul before it shows in our lives...;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2539;I have no literary interests;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2540;Two tasks at the beginning of your life: to narrow your orbit more and more, and ever and again to check whether you are not in hiding somewhere outside your orbit.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2541;In argument similes are like songs in love;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2542;A belief is like a guillotine, just as heavy, just as light.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2543;Un libro dev'essere un'ascia per il mare ghiacciato che è dentro di noi.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2544;It's sometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it's at all possible ever to have any success in one's work here.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2545;But questions that don’t answer themselves at the very moment of their asking are never answered.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2546;In a way, I was safe writing;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2547;Always only the desire to die and the not-yet-yielding;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2548;Als Gregor Samsa eines Morgens aus unruhigen Träumen erwachte, fand er sich in seinem Bett zu einem ungeheueren Ungeziefer verwandelt.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2549;Everything you say is boring and incomprehensible, but that alone doesn't make it true.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2550;Judgement does not come suddenly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2551;I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we’re reading doesn’t wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2552;The main thing, when a sword cuts into one’s soul, is to keep a calm gaze, lose no blood, accept the coldness of the sword with the coldness of a stone. By means of the stab, after the stab, become invulnerable.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2553;Gregor’s serious wound, from which he suffered for over a month - the apple remained imbedded in his flesh as a visible souvenir since no one dared to remove it - seemed to have reminded even his father that Gregor was a member of the family, in spite of his present pathetic and repulsive shape, who could not be treated as an enemy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2554;What is written is merely the dregs of experience.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2555;Man cannot live without a permanent trust in something indestructible in himself, and at the same time that indestructible something as well as his trust in it may remain permanently concealed from him.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2556;"Next time I come here,"" he said to himself, ""I must either bring sweets with me to make them like me or a stick to hit them with.";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2557;It isn’t easy to understand exactly what she is saying, for one doesn’t know whether she is speaking ironically or seriously, it’s mostly serious, but sounds ironic. - Stop interpreting everything! said K.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2558;and in that recurring dream, I found myself trapped in some sort of gigantic game of which I was unfamiliar with the rules;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2559;Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2560;I have this vision: That I would finally come and find you. Scattered pieces of distance would not stand in my way. Not needing words;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2561;من غير الضرورى أن تخرج من بيتك، لازم طاولتك و اصغ، بل دع الإصغاء و اكتفِ بالانتظار، بل دع الإنتظار و اكتفِ بالصمت و العزلة. فسوف يحضر العالم واهباً نفسه لك كى ترفع عنه أقنعته، و منتشياً، سوف يتلوّى أمامك;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2562;The moonlight lay everywhere with the natural peace that is granted to no other light.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2563;The tremendous world I have inside my head. But how [to] free myself and free it without being torn to pieces. And a thousand times [I'd] rather be torn to pieces than rather it in me or bury it. That, indeed, is why I am here, that is quite clear to me.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2564;What am I doing in this eternal winter?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2565;However, Gregor had become much calmer. All right, people did not understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than previously, perhaps because had gotten used to them;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2566;My writing was all about you;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2567;His biggest misgiving came from his concern about the loud crash that was bound to occur and would probably create, if not terror, at least anxiety behind all the doors. But that would have to be risked.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2568;There am I. I cannot leave. I have nothing to complain about. I do not suffer excessively, for I do not suffer consistently, it does not pile up, at least I do not feel it for the time being, and the degree of my suffering is far less than the suffering that is perhaps my due.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2569;4 December. To die would mean nothing else than to surrender a nothing to the nothing, but that would be impossible to conceive, for how could a person, even only as a nothing, consciously surrender himself to the nothing, and not merely to an empty nothing but rather to a roaring nothing whose nothingness consists only in its incomprehensibility.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2570;If something good has lost its way into you, it will make its escape overnight. I know you.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2571;But when I want to draw close to someone, and fully commit myself, then my misery is assured. Then I am nothing, and what can I do with nothingness? I must admit that your letter this morning (by the afternoon it had changed) arrived at just the right moment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2572;The Expulsion from Paradise is eternal in its principal aspect: this makes it irrevocable, and our living in this world inevitable, but the eternal nature of the process has the effect that not only could we remain forever in Paradise, but that we are currently there, whether we know it or not.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2573;Oh, plenty of hope, an infinite amount of hope--but not for us.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2574;The man in ecstasy and the man drowning - both throw up their arms. The first to signify harmony, the second to signify strife with the elements.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2575;I'm not in the right place - alas, I cannot rid myself of the feeling that I'm not in the right place.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2576;Deceptions are more frequent than changes;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2577;It is as if I were made of stone, as if I were my own tombstone, there is no loophole for doubt or for faith, for love or repugnance, for courage or anxiety, in particular or in general, only a vague hope lives on, but no better than the inscriptions on tombstones.;Franz Kafka ,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2578;And I could never understand why you were insensitive to the sorrow and shame you inflicted on me with your words and judgements – it was as if you didn’t sense your own power.  And I certainly made you ill with words;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2579;Then his head sank to the floor of its own accord and from his nostrils came the last faint flicker of his breath.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2580;The meaning of life is that it ends;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2581;Don Quixote's misfortune is not his imagination, but Sancho Panza.;Franza Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2582;So perhaps the best resource is to meet everything passively, to make yourself an inert mass, to stare at others with the eyes of an animal, to feel no compunction, with your own hand to throttle down whatever ghostly life remains in you.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2583;Ein Buch muß die Axt sein für das gefrorene Meer in uns.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2584;Since there was nothing at all I was certain of, since I needed to be provided at every instant with a new confirmation of my existence, since nothing was in my very own, undoubted, sole possession, determined unequivocally only by me — in sober truth a disinherited son — naturally I became unsure even of the thing nearest to me, my own body.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2585;Writer speaks a stench.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2586;It isn't necessary that you leave home. Sit at your desk and listen. Don't even listen, just wait. Don't wait, be still and alone. The whole world will offer itself to you.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2587;There are times when my longing for you overwhelms me […] so often I can think of you only with teeth clenched.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2588;Either the world is so tiny or we are so enormous, in any case we fill it completely.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2589;If they were shocked, then Gregor had no further responsibility and could be calm. But if they took everything calmly, he he, too, had no reason to get excited and could, if he hurried, actually be at the station by eight o'clock.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2590;I am fond of lovers but I cannot love, I am too far away, am banished,;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2591;"Perhaps there is another kind of writing, I only know this one, in the night, when anxiety does not let me sleep, I only know this one. And what is devilish in it seems to me quite clear. It is the vanity and the craving for enjoyment, which is forever whirring around oneself or even around someone else...and enjoying it. The wish that a naive person sometimes has: ""I would like to die and watch others crying over me,"" is what such a writer constantly experiences: he dies (or he does not live) and continually cries over himself";Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2592;The nonexistent is whatever we have not sufficiently desired. Only after death, only in solitude, does a man’s true nature emerge. In death, as on the chimney sweep’s Saturday night, the soot gets washed from his body.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2593;you are the knife i turn inside myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2594;You've seen yourself how difficult the writing is to decipher with your eyes, but our man deciphers it with his wounds.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2595;A picture of my existence... would show a useless wooden stake covered in snow... stuck loosely at a slant in the ground in a ploughed field on the edge of a vast open plain on a dark winter night.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2596;I ought to be able to invent words capable of blowing the odor of corpses in a direction other than straight into mine and the reader's face.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2597;إنه النسيان الألف للحلم الذي ترائي ألف مرة، وتم نسيانه ألف مرة.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2598;I’ll shut myself off from everyone to the point of insensibility. Make an enemy of everyone, speak to no one.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2599;They were offered the choice between becoming kings or the couriers of kings. The way children would, they all wanted to be couriers. Therefore there are only couriers who hurry about the world, shouting to each other - since there are no kings - messages that have become meaningless. They would like to put an end to this miserable life of theirs but they dare not because of their oaths of service. ;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2600;What do I have in common with Jews? I hardly have anything in common with myself, and really ought to go stand myself perfectly still in a corner, grateful to be able to breathe.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2601;I don't know,' I cried without being heard, 'I do not know, If nobody comes, then nobody comes. I've done nobody any harm, nobody's done me any harm, but nobody will help me. A pack of nobodies. Yet that isn't all true. Only, that nobody helps me - a pack of nobodies would be rather fine, on the other hand. I'd love to go on an excursion - why not? - with a pack of nobodies. Into the mountains, of course, where else? How these nobodies jostle each other, all these lifted arms linked together, these numberless feet treading so close! Of course they are all in dress suits. We go so gaily, the wind blows through us and the gaps in our company. Our throats swell and are free in the mountains! It's a wonder that we don't burst into song.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2602;In this love you are like a knife with which I explore myself.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2603;He is afraid the shame will outlive him.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2604;"But I cannot find my way in this darkness,"" said K. ""Turn left to the wall,"" said the priest, ""then follow the wall without leaving it and you'll come to a door."" The priest had already taken a step or two away from him, but K. cried out in a loud voice, ""please wait a moment."" ""I am waiting,"" said the priest. ""Don't you want anything more form me?"" asked K. ""No,"" said the priest. ""You were so friendly to me for a time,"" said K., ""and explained so much to me, and now you let me go as if you cared nothing about me."" ""But you have to leave now,"" said the priest. ""Well, yes,"" said K., ""you must see that I can't help it."" ""You must first see who I am,"" said the priest. ""You are the prison chaplain,"" said K., groping his way nearer to the priest again";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2605;Once again I have told you so little, and have asked no questions, and once again I must close. But not a single answer and, even more certainly, not a single question shall be lost. There exists some kind of sorcery by which two people, without seeing each other, without talking to each other, can at least discover the greater part about each other’s past, literally in a flash, without having to tell each other all and everything;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2606;I am so miserable, there are so many questions, I can see no way out and am so wretched and feeble that I could lie forever on the sofa and keep opening and closing my eyes without knowing the difference.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2607;Some books seem like a key to unfamiliar rooms in one’s own castle.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2608;The crows assert that a single crow could destroy the heavens. This is certainly true, but it proves nothing against the heavens, because heaven means precisely: the impossibility of crows.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2609;Atlas was permitted the opinion that he was at liberty, if he wished, to drop the Earth and creep away;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2610;Time is short, my strength is limited, the office is a horror, the apartment is noisy, and if a pleasant, straightforward life is not possible, then one must try to wriggle through by subtle manoeuvres.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2611;The purpose of a story is to be an axe that breaks up the ice within us.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2612;Idleness is the beginning of all vice, the crown of all virtues.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2613;Down Here and up there are all the same to me. Whether I lie here in the gutter and stow away the rain water or drink champagne up there with the same lips makes no difference to me, not even in the taste.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2614;I can't sleep and the rain is determined not to quit soliloquizing about you all night. I can't help but overhear, my dear.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2615;I could have built the Pyramids with the effort it takes me to cling on to life and reason.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2616;I hate everything that does not relate to literature, conversations bore me (even when they relate to literature), to visit people bores me, the joys and sorrows of my relatives bore me to my soul. Conversation takes the importance, the seriousness, the truth, out of everything I think.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2617;"You're not cross with me, though?"" he said. She pulled her hand away and answered, ""No, no, I'm never cross with anyone.";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2618;One tells as few lies as possible only by telling as few lies as possible and not by having the least possible opportunity to do so.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2619;This afternoon the pain occasioned by my loneliness came upon me so piercingly and intensely that I became aware that the strength which I gain through this writing thus spends itself, a strength which I certainly have not intended for this purpose.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2620;You see, I have only such a fugitive awareness of things around me that I always feel they were once real and are now fleeting away.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2621;In that case, I’ll miss the thing by waiting for it.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2622;I am a retiring, silent, unsociable, and discontent person.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2623;Evil does not exist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2624;And here was your mysterious innocence and invulnerability: you abused others without regret, and you condemned abuse, and said it was forbidden.  You backed your derision with threats, for example, ‘I’ll rip you apart like a fish.’  And that was dreadful to me, even though I knew that nothing bad would happen (yet as a young child I didn’t know this), but your words served as a sign of your power, and you always seemed capable of doing something.  And it was also dreadful when you shouted left and right at the table, and tried to grab someone – or pretended to try – until mother seemingly came to the rescue.  And it appeared to a child that life existed through your mercy, and continued as your unearned gift.  And linked to this were your threats about disobedience and where it would lead.  When I began something which didn’t please you and you threatened me with failure, my awe for your opinion was so great that failure was unavoidable – perhaps at first, if not, then later.  I lost the confidence to do anything.  I was unsettled, doubtful.  And the older I was, the more solid was the material with which you could demonstrate how worthless I was;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2625;The relief of giving in to destruction.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2647;You spend too much time on ephemeras. The majority of modern books are merely wavering reflections of the present. They disappear very quickly. You should read more old books. The classics.

2650;What is love? After all, it is quite simple. Love is everything which enhances, widens, and enriches our life. In its heights and in its depths. Love has as few problems as a motor-car. The only problems are the driver, the passengers, and the road.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2653;As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2654;I think we ought to read only books that bite and sting us. If the book we are reading doesn't shake us awake like a blow on the skull, why bother reading it in the first place? So that it can make us happy, as you put it? Good God, we'd be just as happy if we had no books at all;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2655;During last night’s insomnia, as these thoughts came and went between my aching temples, I realised once again, what I had almost forgotten in this recent period of relative calm, that I tread a terribly tenuous, indeed almost non-existent soil spread over a pit full of shadows, whence the powers of darkness emerge at will to destroy my life…;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2659;I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we are reading doesn't wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for? (...) We need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2662;When K. looked at the castle, often it seemed to him as if he were observing someone who sat quietly there in front of him gazing, not lost in thought and so oblivious of everything, but free and untroubled, as if he were alone with nobody to observe him, and yet must notice that he was observed, and all the same remained with his calm not even slightly disturbed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2665;I felt so weak and unhappy that I buried my face in the ground: I could not bear the strain of seeing around me the things of the earth. I felt convinced that every movement and every thought was forced, and that one had to be on one's guard against them.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2666;"The books were oldand well worn, the cover of one of them had nearly broken through in itsmiddle, and it was held together with a few threads. ""Everything is sodirty here,"" said K., shaking his head, and before he could pick thebooks up the woman wiped some of the dust off with her apron. K. tookhold of the book that lay on top and threw it open, an indecent pictureappeared. A man and a woman sat naked on a sofa, the base intent ofwhoever drew it was easy to see but he had been so grossly lacking inskill that all that anyone could really make out were the man and thewoman who dominated the picture with their bodies, sitting in overlyupright postures that created a false perspective and made it difficultfor them to approach each other. K. didn't thumb through that book anymore, but just threw open the next one at its title page, it was a novelwith the title, What Grete Suffered from her Husband, Hans. ""So this isthe sort of law book they study here,"" said K., ""this is the sort ofperson sitting in judgement over me.";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2669;Of course I'm ignorant, that remains true at all events and is extremely distressing for me, but it does have the advantage that the ignorant man dares more, so I shall gladly put up with ignorance and its undoubtedly dire consequences for a while, as long as my strength lasts.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

""No,"" said the officer, eager to go on with his exposition, but the explorer interrupted him: ""He doesn't know the sentence that has been passed on him?"" ""No,"" said the officer again, pausing a moment as if to let the explorer elaborate his question, and then said: ""There would be no point in telling him.

2674;They were given the choice of becoming kings or the king's messengers. As is the way with children, they all wanted to be messengers.

2677;Anyway, it’s best not to think about them, as if you do it makes the discussions with the other lawyers, all their advice and all that they do manage to achieve, seem so unpleasant and useless, I had that experience myself, just wanted to throw everything away and lay at home in bed and hear nothing more about it. But that, of course, would be the stupidest thing you could do, and you wouldn’t be left in peace in bed for very long either.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2678;It seemed to K. as if at last those people had broken off all relations with him, and as if now in reality he were freer than he had ever been, and at liberty to wait here in this place usually forbidden to him as long as he desired, and had won a freedom such as hardly anybody else had ever succeeded in winning, and as if nobody could dare touch him or drive him away, or even speak to him, but — this conviction was at least equally as strong — as if at the same time there was nothing more senseless, more hopeless, than this freedom, this waiting, this inviolability.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2683;He had always believed that his father had not been able to save a penny from the business, at least his father had never told him anything to the contrary, and Gregor, for his part, had never asked him any questions. In those days Gregor's sole concern had been to do everything in his power to make the family forget as quickly as possible the business disaster which had plunged everyone into a state of total despair. And so he had begun to work with special ardor and had risen almost overnight from stock clerk to traveling salesman, which of course had opened up very different money-making possibilities, and in no time his successes on the job were transformed, by means of commissions, into hard cash that could be plunked down on the table at home in front of his astonished and delighted family. Those had been the wonderful times, and they had never returned, at least not with the same glory, although later on Gregor earned enough money to meet the expenses of the entire family and actually did so. They had just gotten used to it, the family as well as Gregor, the money was received with thanks and given with pleasure, but no special feeling of warmth went with it any more. ;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2684;It puzzled K., at least it puzzled him looking at it from the policemen's point of view, that they had made him go into the room and left him alone there, where he had ten different ways of killing himself. At the same time, though, he asked himself, this time looking at it from his own point of view, what reason he could have to do so. Because those two were sitting there in the next room and had taken his breakfast, perhaps?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2690;Someone must have been telling lies about Joseph K., for without having done anything wrong he was arrested one fine morning.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2691;"He slid back again into his earlier position. ""This getting up early,"" he thought, ""makes a man quite idiotic. A man must have his sleep. Other travelling salesmen live like harem women. For instance, when I come back to the inn during the course of the morning to write up the necessary orders, these gentlemen are just sitting down to breakfast. If I were to try that with my boss, I'd be thrown out on the spot. Still, who knows whether that mightn't be really good for me? If I didn't hold back for my parents' sake, I'd have quit ages ago. I would've gone to the boss and told him just what I think from the bottom of my heart. He would've fallen right off his desk! How weird it is to sit up at that desk and talk down to the employee from way up there. The boss has trouble hearing, so the employee has to step up quite close to him. Anyway, I haven't completely given up that hope yet. Once I've got together the money to pay off my parents' debt to him—that should take another five or six years—I'll do it for sure. Then I'll make the big break. In any case, right now I have to get up. My train leaves at five o'clock";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2697;"When one has apparently made up one’s mind to spend the evening at home and has donned one’s house-jacket and sat down at the lamplit table after supper and do the particular job or play the particular game on completion of which one is in the habit of going to bed, when the weather out is so unpleasant as to make staying in the obvious choice, when one has been sitting quietly at the table for so long already that one’s leaving must inevitably provoke general astonishment, when the stairwell is in any case in darkness and the street door locked, and when in spite of all this one stands up, suddenly ill at ease, changes one’s coat, reappears immediately in street clothes, announces that one has to go out and after a brief farewell does so, feeling that one has left behind one a degree of irritation commensurate with the abruptness with which one slammed the apartment door, when one then finds oneself in the street possessed of limbs that respond to the quite unexpected freedom one has procured for them with out-of-the-ordinary agility, when in the wake of this one decision one feels capable, deep down, of taking any decision, when one realizes with a greater sense of significance than usual that one has, after all, more ability than one has need easily to effect and endure the most rapid change, and when in this frame of mind one walks the long city streets—then for that evening one has stepped completely outside one’s family, which veers into inessentiality, while one’s own person, rock solid, dark with definition, thighs thrusting rhythmically, assumes it true form.	The whole experience is enhanced when at that late hour one looks up a friend to see how he is.";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2698;It is not necessary that you leave the house. Remain at your table and listen. Do not even listen, only wait. Do not even wait, be wholly still and alone.

2702;In general I lacked principally the ability to provide even in the slightest detail for the real future. I thought only of things in the present and their present condition, not because of thoroughness or any special, strong interest, but rather, to the extent that weakness in thinking was not the cause, because of sorrow and fear – sorrow, because the present was so sad for me that I thought I could not leave it before it resolved itself into happiness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2704;Surveyor, in your thoughts you may be reproaching Sordini for not having been prompted by my claim to make inquiries about the matter in other departments. But that would have been wrong, and I want this man cleared of all blame in your thoughts. One of the operating principles of authorities is that the possibility of error is simply not taken into account. This principle is justified by the excellence of the entire organization and is also necessary if matters are to be discharged with the utmost rapidity. So Sordini couldn’t inquire in other departments, besides those departments wouldn’t have answered, since they would have noticed right away that he was investigating the possibility of an error. Chairman, allow me to interrupt you with a question, said K., didn’t you mention a control agency? As you describe it, the organization is such that the very thought that the control agency might fail to materialize is enough to make one ill. You’re very severe, said the chairman, but multiply your severity by a thousand and it will still be as nothing compared with the severity that the authorities show toward themselves. Only a total stranger could ask such a question. Are there control agencies? There are only control agencies. Of course they aren’t meant to find errors, in the vulgar sense of that term, since no errors occur, and even if an error does occur, as in your case, who can finally say that it is an error.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Good God, we also would be happy if we had no books and such books that make us happy we could, if need be, write ourselves.

"" هذا ممكن،"" يقول البواب،"" لكن ليس الآن."" ولما كانت البوابة المفضية إلى القانون مفتوحة حالياً، كما دائماً، وقد تنحى البواب جانباً، انحنى الرجل رغبة في اختلاس النظر عبر البوابة إلى الداخل. ضحك البواب عندما لاحظ ذلك، وقال: "" إذا كان هذا يغريك كثيراً، حاول أن تتخطاني . لكن ليكن في علمك: أني قوي. وأنا لست سوى البواب الأكثر تواضعاً. لكن من غرفة إلى أخرى يقف البوابون، وكل واحد أكثر قوة من الآخر. حتى أنه لا يمكنني الصمود أمام طرفة عين من الثالث."" لم يكن الرجل القادم من الريف يتوقع كل هذه الصعوبات: وفكر بأن القانون لا بد أن يكون متاحاً للجميع دائماً، لكن وهو ينظر الآن عن كثب إلى البواب الذي يرتدي معطفاً من الفراء، إلى أنفه المدبب الكبير و لحيته، التترية السوداء، المهلهلة، الطويلة، قرر بأنه سيكون من الأفضل انتظار الحصول على تصريح بالدخول. أعطاه البواب مقعداً وسمح له بالجلوس جانباً أمام البوابة. جلس هناك لأيام وسنين. قام بالعديد من المحاولات ليدعه يدخل، وقد أضجر البواب بإلحاحه. كثيراً ما كان البواب يحدثه باختصار، سائلاً إياه عن موطنه و أشياء عديدة أخرى، لكنها أسئلة لا مبالية، مثل الأسئلة التي يطرحها العظماء، وينتهي دائما بتصريح مفاده أنه لا يمكنه السماح له بعد بالدخول. الرجل، الذي جهز نفسه بأشياء كثيرة لرحلته، ضحى بها جميعا، مهما بلغت قيمتها، لاستمالة البواب. الذي قبل بها كلها، لكن دائما مع ملاحظة: "" أنا آخذ هذا فقط كي لا تعتقد بأنك لم تفعل ما بوسعك."" ركز الرجل اهتمامه على البواب خلال السنوات الطويلة على نحو يكاد يكون مستمراً. و نسي أمر البوابين الآخرين، وبدا له أن هذا الأول هو العائق الوحيد أمام دخوله إلى القانون. لعن حظه السيء في السنوات الأولى بجرأة و بأعلى صوته ، فيما بعد وهو يتقدم في السن، اكتفى بأن تمتم لنفسه. صار خرفاً، وبما أنه أمضى السنوات الطوال في تأمل البواب بات يعرف حتى البراغيث في ياقته المصنوعة من الفرو، و طلب منها أيضاً أن تساعده على إقناع البواب. أخيرا وقد ضعف بصره، لم يعرف فيما إذا كانت الأشياء المظلمة من حوله حقيقة أو أن عيناه كانتا تخدعانه. لكنه يتبين الآن في الظلمة شعاع لا يخبو يتدفق من البوابة المفضية إلى القانون. الآن ولم يعد لديه بقية من حياة. تلخصت قبل موته في ذهنه خبراته كلها في سؤال وحيد لم يطرحه على البواب بعد. لوح له كي يقترب، ذلك أنه لم يعد يقوى على النهوض بجسده المتيبس. كان على البواب أن ينحني عليه، لأن الفارق الكبير بالطول بينهما تبدل لغير صالح الرجل."" ما الذي لا زلت ترغب في معرفته، إذن؟"" سأل البواب."" أنت نهم."""" الجميع يسعى وراء القانون،"" قال الرجل، "" فكيف حدث خلال هذه السنين الطوال أن ما من أحد سواي توسل الدخول؟"" رأى البواب بأن الرجل شارف على الموت وحتى يتمكن من سماعه، صاح في أذنه: "" ما من أحد آخر يسمح له بالدخول إلى هنا أبداً، لأن هذه البوابة قد خصصت فقط من أجلك. وأنا الآن سأقوم بإغلاقها.";Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2722;But please, father, understand me correctly: these were completely insignificant details, yet they oppressed me, because you, a great man of authority, could lay down rules for me, and ignore them.  And through this I saw that the world was divided into three parts: in the first lived the slave, me, under laws invented solely for my life but to which, without understanding why, I could never fully adjust;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The gateway to the law is open as it always is, and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over to try and see in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and says, ""If you're tempted give it a try, try and go in even though I say you can't. Careful though: I'm powerful.

2731;It seems so dreadful to be a bachelor, to become an old man struggling to keep one's dignity while begging for an invitation whenever one wants to spend an evening in company, having to carry one's meal home in one's hand, unable to expect anyone with a lazy sense of calm confidence, able only with difficulty and vexation to give a gift to someone, having to say good night at the front door, never being able to run up a stairway beside one's wife, to lie ill and have only the solace of the view from one's window when one can sit up, to have only side doors in one's room leading into other people's living rooms, to feel estranged from one’s family, with whom one can keep on close terms only by marriage, first by the marriage of one's parents, then, when the effect of that has worn off, by one's own, having to admire other people's children and not even being allowed to go on saying: I have none myself, never to feel oneself grow older since there is no family growing up around one, modeling oneself in appearance and behavior on one or two bachelors remembered from our youth.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2732;There were dark hours, of course, such as came to everybody, in which you thought you had achieved nothing at all, in which it seemed to you that only the cases predestined from the start to seucceed came to a good end, which they would have reached in any event without your help, while every one of the others was doomed to fail in spite of all your manœuvres, all your exertions, all the illusory little victories on which you plumed yourself.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2733;Away in the distance, a train appeared behind the trees, all its compartments were lit, the windows were sure to be open. One of us started singing a ballad, but we all wanted to sing. We sang far quicker than the speed of the train, we swung our arms because our voices weren't enough, our voices got into a tangle where we felt happy. If you mix your voice with others' voices, you feel as though you're caught on a hook. (trans. Michael Hofmann);Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2737;There is a story, for instance, that has very much the ring of truth about it. It goes like this: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers. He had been studying it for a day and a night without a break — as these officials are indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do. When it was nearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps. The lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2739;Guilt is never to be doubted.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2740;The difficulties (which other people surely find incredible) I have in speaking to people arise from the fact that my thinking, or rather the content of my consciousness, is entirely nebulous, that I remain undisturbed by this, so far as it concerns only myself, and am even occasionally self-satisfied;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2752;It is entirely conceivable that life's splendour forever lies in wait about each one of us in all its fullness, but veiled from our view, deep down, invisible, far off. It is there, though, not hostile, not reluctant, not deaf. If you summon it by the right word, by its right name, it will come. This is the essence of magic, which does not create but summonsFranz Kafka, 18 October 1921Es ist sehr gut denkbar, dass die Herrlichkeit des Lebes um jeden und immer in ihrer ganzen Fülle bereitliegt, aber verhängt, in der Tiefe, unsichtbar, sehr weit. Aber sie liegt dort, nicht feindselig, nicht widerwillig, nicht taub. Ruft man sie mit dem richtigen Wort, beim richtigen Namen, dann kommt sie. Das ist das Wesen der Zauberei, die nicht schafft, sondern ruft.Kafkas Tagebücher,18 Oktober 1921;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2753;It was because of impatience that they were expelled from Paradise;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2754;I did not fall heavily, nor did I feel any pain, but I felt so weak and unhappy that I buried my face in the ground: I could not bear the strain of seeing around me the things of the earth. I felt convinced that every movement and every thought was forced, and that one had to be one’s guard against them. Yet nothing seemed more natural than to lie here on the grass, my arms beside my body, my face hidden.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2761;You can hold back from the suffering of the world, you have permission to do so, and it is in accordance with your nature. But perhaps this very holding back is the one suffering that you could have avoided.;Kafka Franz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2762;When one has lived for thirty years in this world and had to fight one's way through it, as I have had to do, one becomes hardened to surprises and doesn't take them too seriously.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2763;As someone said to me--I can't remember now who it was--it is really remarkable that when you wake up in the morning you nearly always find everything in exactly the same place as the evening before. For when asleep and dreaming you are, apparently at least, in an essentially different state from that of wakefulness;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2766;Everyone strives to attain the Law,' answers the man, 'how does it come about, then, that in all these years no one has come seeking admittance but me?' The doorkeeper perceives that the man is nearing his end and his hearing is failing, so he bellows in his ear: 'No one but you could gain admittance through this door, since this door was intended for you. I am now going to shut it.;Kafka, Franz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2770;You once said you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write (I can’t do much, anyway), but in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2774;He has two antagonists: the first presses him from behind, from the origin. The second blocks the road ahead. He gives battle to both. To be sure, the first supports him in his fight with the second, for he wants to push him forward, and in the same way the second supports him in his fight with the first, since he drives him back. But it is only theoretically so. For it is not only the two antagonists who are there, but he himself as well, and who really knows his intentions? His dream, though, is that some time in an unguarded moment and this would require a night darker than any night has ever been yet he will jump out of the fighting line and be promoted, on account of his experience in fighting, to the position of umpire over his antagonists in their fight with each other.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2782;Wenn Du vor mir stehst und mich ansiehst, was weißt Du von den Schmerzen, die in mir sind und was weiß ich von den Deinen. Und wenn ich mich vor Dir niederwerfen würde und weinen und erzählen, was wüsstest Du von mir mehr als von der Hölle, wenn Dir jemand erzählt, sie ist heiß und fürchterlich. Schon darum sollten wir Menschen voreinander so ehrfürchtig, so nachdenklich, so liebend stehn wie vor dem Eingang zur Hölle.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2784;How are we to avoid those in office becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2785;When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours? And if I were to cast myself down before you and weep and tell you, what more would you know about me than you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful? For that reason alone we human beings ought to stand before one another as reverently, as reflectively, as lovingly, as we would before the entrance to Hell.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2786;Write to me only once a week, so that your letter arrives on Sunday — for I cannot endure your daily letters, I am incapable of enduring them. For instance, I answer one of your letters, then lie in bed in apparent calm, but my heart beats through my entire body and is conscious only of you. I belong to you;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2791;I was wise, if you like, because I was prepared for death at any moment, but not because I had taken care of everything that was given to me to do, rather because I had done none of it and could not even hope ever to do any of it.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2792;Oh, God, he thought, what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2793;I am forever chained to myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2794;Ich schreibe anders als ich rede, ich rede anders als ich denke, ich denke anders als ich denken soll und so geht es weiter bis ins tiefste Dunkel.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2795;É bom quando nossa consciência sofre grandes ferimentos, pois isso a torna mais sensível a cada estímulo. Penso que devemos ler apenas livros que nos ferem, que nos afligem. Se o livro que estamos lendo não nos desperta como um soco no crânio, por que perder tempo lendo-o? Para que ele nos torne felizes, como você diz? Oh Deus, nós seríamos felizes do mesmo modo se esses livros não existissem. Livros que nos fazem felizes poderíamos escrever nós mesmos num piscar de olhos. Precisamos de livros que nos atinjam como a mais dolorosa desventura, que nos assolem profundamente – como a morte de alguém que amávamos mais do que a nós mesmos –, que nos façam sentir que fomos banidos para o ermo, para longe de qualquer presença humana – como um suicídio. Um livro deve ser um machado para o mar congelado que há dentro de nós;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2796;A man doesn’t need to fly to the sun, he need only find a patch of clean earth, and crawl there, and let the sun shine on him.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2800;But what now if all the peace, the comfort, the contentment were to come to a horrible end?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2801;It seemed to k. as if all contact with him had been cut and he was more of a free agent than ever. He could wait here, in a place usually forbidden to him, as long as he liked, and he also felt as if he gad won that freedom with more effort than most people could manage to make, and no one could touch him or drive him away, why, they hardly had a right even to adress him. But at the same time - and this feeling was at least as strong - he felt as if there were nothing more meaningless and more desperate than this freedom, this waiting, this invulnerability.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2802;I repeat: there was no attraction for me in imitating human beings;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2803;I believe that we should only read those books that bite and sting us. If a book does not rouse us with a blow then why read it?;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2804;The gesture of rejection with which I was forever met did not mean: 'I do not love you,' but: 'You cannot love me, much as you would like;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2805;Because, said the hunger artist, lifting his head a little and, with his lips pursed as if for a kiss, speaking right into the supervisor’s ear so that he wouldn’t miss anything, because I couldn’t find a food which I enjoyed. If had found that, believe me, I would not have made a spectacle of myself and would have eaten to my heart’s content, like you and everyone else. Those were his last words, but in his failing eyes there was the firm, if no longer proud, conviction that he was continuing to fast.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2806;We can't carry on like this. Maybe you can't see it, but I can. I don't want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2807;È ridicolo come ti sei bardato per questo mondo.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2808;Once more the odious courtesies began, the first handed the knife across K. to the second, who handed it across K. back again to the first. K. now perceived clearly that he was supposed to seize the knife himself, as it traveled from hand to hand above him, and plunge it into his own breast. But he did not do so, he merely turned his head, which was still free to move, and gazed around him. He could not completely rise to the occasion, he could not relieve the officials of all their tasks;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2809;How lonely it is here, and how well it suits you.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2810;Oh, bother.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2811;Seen with the terrestrially sullied eye, we are in a situation of travelers in a train that has met with an accident in a tunnel, and this at a place where the light of the beginning can no longer be seen, and the light of the end is so very small a glimmer that the gaze must continually search for it and is always losing it again, and, furthermore, both the beginning and the end are not even certainties. Round about us, however, in the confusion of our senses, or in the supersensitiveness of our senses, we have nothing but monstrosities and a kaleidoscopic play of things that is either delightful or exhausting according to the mood and injury of each individual. What shall I do? or: Why should I do it? are not questions to be asked in such places.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2812;Evil has ways of surprising one. Suddenly it turns round and says: You have misunderstood me, and perhaps it really is so. Evil transforms itself into your own lips, lets itself be gnawed at by your teeth, and with these new lips -- no former ones fitted smoothly to your gums -- to your own amazement you utter the words of goodness.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2813;You once said that you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2814;Mientras estaba tendido allí, a un paso de mí yacía un escarabajo, patas arriba, desesperado. No podía enderezarse, me habría gustado ayudarlo, era tan fácil hacerlo, bastaba un paso y un empujoncito para brindarle una ayuda efectiva. Pero lo olvidé a causa de la carta. Además no podía ponerme de pie. Por fin, una lagartija logró que volviera a tomar conciencia de la vida que me rodeaba. Su camino la llevó hasta el escarabajo, que ya estaba totalmente inmóvil. De modo que no fue un accidente, me dije, sino una lucha mortal, el raro espectáculo de la muerte natural de un animal. Pero la lagartija al deslizarse por encima del escarabajo, lo enderezó. Por uno instantes continuó inmóvil, como muerto, pero luego trepó la pared como la cosa más natural. Es probable que eso me haya brindado, de alguna manera, un poco de coraje. Lo cierto es que me puse de pie, bebí leche y le escribí a usted.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2819;Your will is free means: it was free when it wanted the desert, it is free since it can choose the path that leads to crossing the desert, it is free since it can choose the pace, but it is also unfree since you must go through the desert, unfree since every path in labyrinthine manner touches every foot of the desert’s surface.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2820;The amount of quiet I need does not exist in the world, from which it follows that no one ought to need so much quiet.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2827;No es necesario que salgas de casa. Quédate a tu mesa y escucha. Ni siquiera escuches, espera solamente. Ni siquiera esperes, quédate completamente solo y en silencio. El mundo llegará a ti para hacerse desenmascarar, no puede dejar de hacerlo, se prosternará extático a tus pies.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2828;Es perfectamente imaginable que el esplendor de la vida esté dispuesto, siempre en toda plenitud, alrededor de cada uno, pero cubierto de un velo, en las profundidades, invisible, muy lejos. Sin embargo está ahí, no hostil, no a disgusto, no sordo, viene si uno lo llama con la palabra correcta, por su nombre correcto. Es la esencia de la magia, que no crea, sino llama.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2829;Did he really want this warm room of his, so comfortably fitted with old family furniture, to be transformed into a cave, in which, no doubt, he would be free to crawl about unimpeded in all directions, but only at the price of rapidly and completely forgetting his human past at the same time?;Frank Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2830;Gregor, open up, I'm pleading with you.' But Gregor had absolutely no intention of opening the door and complimented himself instead on the precaution he had adopted from his business trips of locking all the doors during the night even at home.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2831;Como eu te amo (e portanto eu amo-te, sua tola, tal como o mar ama um minúsculo seixo no seu fundo, é exactamente assim que te cubro com o meu amor - e oxalá seja também um seixo ao teu lado, se o céu o permitir), amo o mundo inteiro, a que pertence também o ombro esquerdo, não primeiro era o ombro direito e, por isso, beijo-o quando isso me dá prazer (e tu tens a amabilidade de despir aí a blusa), o ombro esquerdo está também incluído e o teu rosto debaixo de mim no bosque e o repousar no teu peito quase desnudado. E por isso tens razão quando dizes que já fomos um único ser, e não tenho nenhum medo disso, pelo contrário, é a minha única felicidade e o meu único orgulho e não o restrinjo de modo nenhum ao bosque.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2845;Altogether, I think we ought to read only books that bite and sting us. If the book we are reading doesn’t shake us awake like a blow to the skull, why bother reading it in the first place?

2852;All the people who try to torment me, and who have now occupied the entire space around me, will quite gradually be thrust back by the beneficent passage of these days, without my having to help them even in the very least.

2859;Κανένας άλλος δε μπορούσε να γίνει δεκτός εδώ, γιατί η είσοδος ήταν για σένα προορισμένη. Πηγαίνω τώρα να την κλείσω.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2860;Leo en Dostoievski el pasaje que tanto se asemeja a ser desdichado;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2861;Why then do you fear love in particular more than earthly existence in general? Kafka replied as if from an astral distance: You write: ‘Why be more afraid of love than of other things in life?’ And just before that: ‘I experienced the intermittently divine for the first time, and more frequently than elsewhere, in love.’ If you conjoin these two sentences, it’s as if you had said: ‘Why not fear every bush in the same way that you fear the burning bush?;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2862;Düz bir yolda yürüyor olsaydın, tüm ilerleme isteğine rağmen hala gerisin geriye gitseydin, o zaman bu çaresiz bir durum olurdu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2863;Yet Gregor's sisterwas playing so beautifully. Her face was leant to one side,following the lines of music with a careful and melancholyexpression. Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping hishead close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if thechance came.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2864;All right then, I’ll be mad at you on this score, which incidentally is no great misfortune, as things balance out quite well if there’s a little anger for you lurking in one corner of my heart.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2865;In a light that is fierce and strong one can see the world dissolve. To weak eyes it becomes solid, to weaker eyes it shows fists;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2866;It is to us artisans and tradesmen that the salvation of the fatherland is entrusted;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2867;Evil is the starry sky of the Good.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2868;Incidentally, it’s easy to write prescriptions, but difficult to come to an understanding with people.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2869;People under suspicion are better moving than at rest, since at rest they may be sitting in the balance without knowing it, being weighed together with their sins.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2870;Over the table, on which an unpacked line of fabric samples was all spread out -- Samsa was a traveling salesman -- hung the picture which he had recently cut out of a glossy magazine and lodged in a pretty gilt frame. It showed a lady done up in a fur hat and a fur boa, sitting upright and raising up against the viewer a heavy fur muff in which her whole forearm had disappeared.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2872;It's always questionable to intervene decisively in strange circumstances.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2873;The history of mankind is the instant between two strides taken by a traveler.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2874;For example, my choice of career. You generously and patiently gave me complete freedom.  Though this followed the habits, or at least the values, of the Jewish middle class concerning their sons.  And here your misunder-standing of my character worked its effect, which – together with your father’s pride – blinded you to my real nature: to my weakness.  In your opinion, I was always studying as a child, and  later I was always writing.  Looking back that      is certainly not true.  I can say with very little exaggeration, I barely studied and I learnt nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2875;I am more uncertain than I ever was;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2876;He had indeed been so close to forgetting that only the voice of the mother, so long unheard, brought him to his senses.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2877;"Extraordinary,' said the Burgomaster, 'extraordinary. And now do you think of staying here in Riva with us?' 'I think not', said the Hunter with a smile, and, to excuse himself, he laid his hand on the Burgomaster's knee. 'I am here, more than that I do not know, further than that I cannot go. My ship has no rudder, and it is driven by the wind that blows in the undermost regions of death.'(""The Hunter Gracchus"")";Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2878;(...) when I try to write down something like the following, the swords whose points surround me in a circle, begin slowly to approach the body, it's the most complete torture;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2879;It's characteristic of this judicial system that a man is condemned not only when he's innocent but also in ignorance.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2880;We are sinful not only because we have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, but also because we have not yet eaten of the Tree of Life. The state in which we are is sinful, irrespective of guilt.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2881;„Ich glaube, man sollte überhaupt nur noch solche Bücher lesen, die einen beißen und stechen. Wenn das Buch, das wir lesen, uns nicht mit einem Faustschlag auf den Schädel weckt, wozu lesen wir dann das Buch? Ein Buch muß die Axt sein für das gefrorene Meer in uns.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2882;Only those burdened with a common affliction understand each other. Thanks to their affliction they constitute a circle and provide each other mutual support. They glide along the inner borders of their circle, make way for or jostle one another gently in the crowd... There exists not the shadow of a thought to give the comforter an advantage over the comforted. Thus their conversations consist only of a coming-together of their imaginations, outpourings of wishes from one upon the other... Sometimes they will unite in faith and, their heads together, look up into the unending reaches of the sky. Recognition of their situation shows itself, however, only when they bow down their heads in common and the common hammer descends upon them.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2883;Querido padre:Me preguntaste una vez por qué afirmaba yo que te tengo miedo.Como de costumbre, no supe qué contestar, en parte, justamente por elmiedo que te tengo, y en parte porque en los fundamentos de ese miedoentran demasiados detalles como para que pueda mantenerlos reunidosen el curso de una conversación. Y, aunque intente ahora contestartepor escrito, mi respuesta será, no obstante, muy incomprensible, porquetambién al escribir el miedo y sus consecuencias me inhiben anteti, y porque la magnitud del tema excede mi memoria y mi entendimiento.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2884;"But the hands of one of the gentleman were laid on K.’s throat, while the other pushed the knife deep into his heart and twisted it there, twice. As his eyesight failed, K. saw the two gentlemen cheek by cheek, close in front of his face, watching the result. Like a dog! he said, it was as if the shame of it should outlive him."".";Franz Kafka The Trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2885;There is a place where I never was before: here breathing is different, and more dazzling than the sun is the radiance of a star beside it.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2886;I hope it is nothing serious. On the other hand, I must also say that we business people, luckily or unluckily, however one looks at it, very often simply have to overcome a slight indisposition for business reasons.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2887;Jemand musste Josef K. verleumdet haben, denn ohne dass er etwas Böses getan hätte, wurde er eines Morgens verhaftet.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2888;"I was making for that city in the south of which it was said in our village:""There you'll find queer folk! Just think, they never sleep!""""And why not?""""Because they never get tired.""""And why not?""""Because they're fools.""""Don't fools get tired?""""How could fools get tired!""---Children on a Country Road, Contemplation.";Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2889;I had to arrange things as well as I could. That's obviously a very bad place for the bed, in front of the door. For instance when the judge I'm painting at present comes he always comes through the door by the bed, and I've even given him a key to this door so that he can wait for me here in the studio when I'm not home. Although nowadays he usually comes early in the morning when I'm still asleep. And of course, it always wakes me up when I hear the door opened beside the bed, however fast asleep I am. If you could hear the way I curse him as he climbs over my bed in the morning you'd lose all respect for judges. I suppose I could take the key away from him but that'd only make things worse. It only takes a tiny effort to break any of the doors here off their hinges.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2890;My health is only just good enough for myself alone, not good enough for marriage, let alone fatherhood. Yet when I read your letter, I feel I could overlook even what cannot possibly be overlooked.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2891;Sometimes, and I don’t know why, everything I want to say to you presses upon me with great intensity, like a crowd of people all trying to squeeze through a narrow door at once. And I have said nothing to you, less than nothing, for everything I have written recently has been false—not fundamentally, of course, because fundamentally everything is true—but with so much confusion and falseness on the surface that no one could be expected to see through it.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2892;The only thing I can do now, he said to himself, and his thought was confirmed by the equal length of his own steps with the steps of the two others, the only thing I cando now is keep my common sense and do what’s needed right till the end. I always wanted to go at the world and try and do too much, and even to do it for something that was not too cheap. That was wrong of me. Should I now show them I learned nothing from facing trial for a year? ShouldI go out like someone stupid? Should I let anyone say, after I’m gone, that at the start of the proceedings I wanted to end them, and that now that they’ve ended I want to start them again? I don’t want anyone to say that. I’m grateful they sent these unspeaking, uncomprehending men to go with me on this journey, and that it’s been left up to me to say what’s necessary;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2893;"Ocurrió que el cerebro no pudo soportar más las preocupaciones y dolores que le habían sido impuestos. Y entonces dijo: ""Me doy por vencido";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2894;Cascar una nuez no es realmente un arte, y en consecuencia nadie se atrevería a congregar un auditorio para entretenerle cascando nueces. Pero si lo hace y logra su propósito, entonces ya no se trata meramente de cascar nueces. O tal vez se trate meramente de cascar nueces, pero entonces descubrimos que nos hemos despreocupado totalmente de dicho arte porque lo dominábamos demasiado, y este nuevo cascador de nueces nos muestra por primera vez la esencia real del arte, al punto de que podría convenirle, para un mayor efecto, ser un poco menos hábil en cascar nueces que la mayoría de nosotros.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2895;If you were walking across a plain, had an honest intention of walking on, and yet kept regressing, then it would be a desperate matter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2896;Evinden çıkman gerekmez. Masandan kalkma ve dinle. Hatta dinleme, yalnızca bekle. Hatta bekleme bile, tamamen sessiz ve yalnız ol. Dünya, maskesini düşüresin diye, gelip kendini sunacaktır sana, başka türlü olamaz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2897;The main thing holding the family back from a change in living quarters was far more their complete hopelessness and the idea that they had been struck by a misfortune like no one else in their entire circle of relatives and acquaintances.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2898;"A Little Fable""Alas,"" said the mouse, ""the whole world is growing smaller every day. At the beginning it was so big that I was afraid, I kept running and running, and I was glad when I saw walls far away to the right and left, but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that I am in the last chamber already, and there in the corner stands the trap that I must ...";Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2900;Utter despair, impossible to pull myself together;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2901;It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2902;Before setting foot in the Holy of the Holies you must take off your shoes, yet not only your shoes, but everything;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2903;In our folk nobody has any experience of youth, there’s barely even any time for being a toddler. The children simply don’t have any time in which they might be children........Indeed... there’s simply no way that we would be able to provide our children with a viable childhood, one that is real. Naturally, there are consequences. There’s a certain ever present, not to be liquidated childishness that permeates our folk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2904;How suicidal happiness can be!;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2905;Wir brauchen aber die Bücher, die auf uns wirken wie ein Unglück, das uns sehr schmerzt, wie der Tod eines, den wie lieber hatten als uns, wie wenn wir in Wälder verstoßen würden, von allen Menschen weg, wie ein Selbstmord, ein Buch muss die Axt sein für das gefrorene Meer in uns.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2906;He accepted it as a fundamental principle for an accused man to be always forearmed, never to let himself be caught napping, never to let his eyes stray unthinkingly to the right when his judge was looming up on the left--to the right when his judge was looming up on the left--and against that very principle he kept offending again and again.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2907;For humans the idea of freedom is all too often a means of deceiving themselves. And although freedom is among the most exalted of feelings, so is the illusion of freedom among the most exalted of illusions.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2908;The messiah will come when we don't need him anymore.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2910;Hiding places there are innumerable, escape is only one, but possibilities of escape, again, are as many as hiding places.;Franz Kafka,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2911;His wounds, incidentally, must have healed up by now, he felt no handicap anymore, which was astonishing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2912;If you utter it, who will think of opposing you? The great choir of dogdom will join in as if it had been waiting for you. Then you will have clarity, truth, avowal, as much of them as you desire. The roof of this wretched life, of which you say so many hard things, will burst open, and all of us, shoulder to shoulder, will ascend into the lofty realm of freedom. And if we should not achieve the final consummation, if things should become worse than before, if the whole truth should be more insupportable than the half-truth, if it should be proved that the silent are the guardians of existence, if the faint hope that we still possess should give way to complete hopelessness, the attempt is still worth the trial, since you do not desire to live as you are compelled to live.;Franz Kafka;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
